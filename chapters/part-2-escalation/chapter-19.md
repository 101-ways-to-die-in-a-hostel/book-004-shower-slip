# Chapter 19: The Slanted Morning

The room is leaning again.

It leans left, slowly, like a ship that doesn't intend to go down but isn't fighting it either. I lie there and let it tilt me, the mattress soft with other people's sweat and my own sour breath. The ceiling above is a patchwork of graffiti and old leaks. Someone drew a shark with a beer in its fin. The shark's eye looks worried. I feel like the shark.

I sit up. My stomach floats somewhere under my ribs and my head stays where it was. The air tastes like stale lager and sleeping bodies. My tongue is dry and swollen, a strip of felt. I reach for my water bottle and find it empty. Of course it's empty. The other side of my bunk is lined with little dumb decisions: the broken sandal with the snapped strap, the towel that smells like mildew, the shower mat folded into a neat square like a gift I don't deserve.

Outside the dorm, the bathroom door slams. Someone coughs like they're trying to cough up a brick. The shower turns on, a hiss that creeps through the wall. It sounds like a warning, but the hostel doesn't do those. It does jokes.

I stand and the floor tries to keep me. The wobble is gentle at first, like a drunk friend putting a hand on your shoulder, then it gets worse, the leftward tilt. I grab the bunk frame and breathe until it settles.

"Standard hangover," I tell myself. "Standard." Saying it out loud feels like a spell. It doesn't work.

On the floor, my sandals look even more tragic than last night. One strap hangs like a loose tooth. I tie a knot in it, pull it tight. The knot looks ridiculous. It will probably fall apart the second I step on it. I should go down to reception and ask Kuba for another pair. I should do a lot of things.

The shower mat waits like a dog by the door. I pick it up. It's cold, tacky, the suction cups like tiny mouths. It feels heavier now, like the weight of doing the right thing. I tuck it under my arm and step into the hallway.

The line of water is there, a silver stripe cutting through the green emergency light. I step over it, then back because I don't trust myself to step over it. Marta is mopping at the far end, her mop pushing the water around in patient circles. She looks up as I pass.

"You again," she says.

"Me again," I say. My voice sounds like it slept in a gutter.

She nods at the mat under my arm. "Still trying?"

"It'll stick today," I say. I know it won't.

She makes the sound she makes when she doesn't believe you but doesn't have the energy to correct you. The mop drags. The floor shines. The whole hallway smells like bleach and damp socks.

In the bathroom, the light flickers like a tired heartbeat. The air is warmer here, thick with steam and mildew. The showers are all occupied. Curtains cling to bodies and dripping towels. The sound is a chorus of water hitting concrete. It's loud enough to cover the world, quiet enough for you to hear your own pulse.

I wait by the sinks, mat under my arm, and watch the water slide in slow lines toward the drain. There's a smear on the wall by the second stall. Darker than the graffiti, darker than the mildew. It looks like someone dragged a palm there, like they tried to steady themselves and left a print of something that isn't just water. The last time I saw it, it was faint. Today it's not.

My stomach clenches. I touch the side of my head without thinking, just above my ear. I imagine the pipe there, the copper tooth, the way it would feel to hit it. I shake it off. It's just a mark. It's just someone with a cut. People are always getting cuts.

"Morning, legend," someone says.

It's Mae, towel around her shoulders, cheeks flushed from hot water. She looks more awake than she should. She steps around the puddles like she was born on a wet floor.

"Morning," I say. "You survive?"

"Barely." She grins, then notices the mat. "You're still on that kick."

I hold it up. "This is my retirement plan."

She laughs. "If that thing holds you, I'll buy you breakfast."

The curtain on the second stall moves. A guy steps out, dripping, eyes half-lidded. He sees the smear on the wall and frowns.

"What happened there?" he asks.

Mae looks. "Someone probably went arse over," she says. "It's a rite of passage."

He shrugs, grabs his towel, shuffles out. The smear remains, a question nobody wants to answer. The water keeps running. The floor keeps shining.

The far-left stall opens. I step in with my mat. The concrete is gritty, cold under my feet even through the thin rubber of my sandals. I unroll the mat and press it down. The suction cups look at the uneven floor and give up immediately. The mat curls at the edges like a bad smile.

"Come on," I mutter, pushing down with my palms. The concrete is slick. The mat skates a centimeter.

I press harder. The mat holds for half a second, then slides again. It doesn't stick. It won't. The floor is too pitted, the surface too wet. It's a bad match. It's a joke. The mat is a lie someone sold me.

I sigh, straighten, and look at my reflection in the tile. I look tired. I look pale. My eyes are too bright, the whites too red. There's a tremor in my hands when I lift them.

"Just be careful," I tell myself.

The water is cold when I turn it on. The shock is good. It burns the alcohol out of my skin, or that's what it feels like. The warm comes slowly. I keep one hand on the wall as if the wall might change its mind and leave. The showerhead sprays unevenly, some jets hitting my shoulders, some the wall. It sounds like rain on a tin roof.

I close my eyes for a second and the room spins. I open them fast. The spin slows. I breathe.

There's a bump under my sandal as I shift, a ridge in the concrete. The mat slips again. My foot skates a fraction. It's so small it would barely be a slip if I was sober. My heart jumps anyway. I grab the wall, the tile slick with soap, and feel my fingers slide. I catch myself on the corner of the stall instead, the edge biting into my palm.

"Mate," I whisper to myself, and my voice is a laugh that isn't a laugh.

I rinse, fast. I don't wash my hair. I don't linger. I don't do the long stare at the wall where my brain goes quiet. I get out. I turn the water off like I'm stopping a fight.

As I step out, the stall beside me opens. A British guy with a towel around his waist steps into the shared space, eyes still half asleep. His foot hits the puddle at the threshold. He slips. It's not a full fall—just a skid—and he slams his shoulder into the sink with a dull sound.

"Jesus," he says, grabbing his arm.

"You all right?" I ask, already moving toward him.

"Yeah, yeah." He laughs, but it's thin. He rubs his shoulder and winces. "Bloody ice rink."

He looks at the smear on the wall and shakes his head. "Didn't even see that," he mutters.

I want to tell him to be careful, but the words feel useless. Instead I say, "Welcome to Mad House."

He laughs again, because that's what people do here. He wraps his towel tighter and leaves a wet trail in the hallway. The water keeps running. The smear stays.

I dry off and leave the mat propped against the wall, as if it might stick by sheer will. It looks like a limp tongue. I know it will be gone by afternoon.

Back in the dorm, I pull on a singlet and shorts. The broken sandal strap holds for now. I throw the mat in my locker anyway, because I'm not ready to watch it disappear again. I check my phone. Two messages from Mum. One from my sister. I read my sister's first: You okay? Saw your story. You look wrecked. It hits me in the chest, soft and hard at once. I type, All good, just tired. Love you. I stare at it. I send it. I don't answer Mum.

Downstairs, the bar is waking up. The smell of toast is a low, comforting thing, like a blanket that doesn't quite cover you. Kuba is behind the counter, already in motion, pouring coffee, wiping surfaces that don't get clean.

He looks up. "You look like you got in a fight with a mop."

"The mop won," I say, and sit. The chair is sticky. The bar always is.

He slides a glass of water toward me. "You're late."

"The shower tried to kill me again," I say.

"The shower is consistent," he says. "We should put it on the payroll."

I laugh, and it comes out thin. "Someone left a handprint on the wall in there."

Kuba's smile doesn't move. "There is always a handprint," he says. "We just clean it when the reviews are low."

He says it like it's a joke. It isn't. I take a sip of water. It tastes like metal and relief.

"Filip wants to do a meeting tonight," Kuba says. "About safety."

I raise an eyebrow. "We have safety?"

He shrugs. "He wants us to sign a paper saying we told people not to shower drunk."

"We do tell them," I say.

"We do tell them," Kuba repeats, like he's practicing for a lawyer. "People don't listen. We keep the party going anyway."

The truth sits on the counter between us. We both look away from it.

Liv drops into the chair beside me, hair in a messy bun, dark circles under her eyes. "Why is the light so loud?" she asks, squinting.

"Because you are hungover," Kuba says.

"I'm not hungover," she says. "I'm pre-hungover."

She reaches for my water and takes a sip without asking. I let her. It tastes like community. She looks at my sandals and winces. "Those aren't going to last the day."

"Neither am I," I say.

She laughs, then stops when she sees my face. "Hey. You okay?"

"Yeah," I say. "Just tired."

"We're all tired," she says, but her eyes stay on me a second longer than the joke.

The morning crawls by. People drift in with towels over their shoulders, hair damp, faces pale. Someone complains about the showers. Someone says, "That's Mad House, mate." It becomes a chorus.

A new group comes in, backpacks still on, cheeks pink from the cold. They look clean. They look alive. I hate how fresh they look.

Kuba nods at me. "Give them the tour, Brad. You're good at making it sound fun."

I grab my water and stand. "All right," I say, clapping my hands once. "Welcome to the circus."

They follow me like ducklings. I show them the bar, the chalkboard of themed nights, the wall of polaroids with faces frozen mid-laugh. I show them the rage cage and tell them it's optional. I show them the kitchen and tell them not to cook anything complicated. They laugh. I make it a joke because that's how we do.

On the third floor, I stop by the bathroom. The door is open. The light flickers. The smear on the wall is still there, now a darker streak that runs down toward the tile. I pretend not to notice.

"This is the bathroom," I say. "Water is hot sometimes. Floor is... adventurous."

One of the new arrivals, a Canadian guy with freckles, peers inside. "Looks fine," he says.

I snort. "That's the correct amount of optimism for this place."

A girl in a yellow beanie steps closer, eyes narrowing at the floor. "Is that mold?"

"That's art," I say. "We call it Murder Green. It'll grow on you."

They laugh. I laugh with them. In the corner of my eye, the pipe in the second stall gleams. The copper catches the flicker of the light and flashes like a warning. I hear my own voice: "Watch your head if you're tall." I say it like a joke. It isn't.

The tour ends back at the bar. They tip me in beers. I take one. It isn't even noon. I tell myself it's fine because it's always fine until it isn't.

A shout comes from the stairwell. The kind that starts as a laugh and ends as a sharp intake of breath. I glance over. Two guys are helping a third down the stairs, one arm slung over each of their shoulders. His hair is wet, his eyes glassy, and there's a wad of toilet paper pressed to the side of his head. The toilet paper is already pink.

"You all right?" I ask, standing.

"Yeah, yeah," he says, and the lie is in the way he won't look at me. "Just clipped the pipe."

The words make my stomach flip. "The pipe in the second stall?"

"The only pipe worth anything in this place," one of his mates says, trying to make it a joke.

The injured guy laughs, then winces. The toilet paper slips, revealing a thin line of blood along his hairline. It isn't a lot, but it's bright. It looks wrong against his skin.

"You should get that looked at," I say.

"Nah," he says. "Just a nick. It stings like hell."

Marta appears with her mop, as if blood is a beacon she can't ignore. She takes one look at the toilet paper and clucks her tongue.

"Sit," she says, pointing at a chair by the bar.

"I'm fine," he says.

She doesn't smile. "Sit," she repeats, and this time he does. She grabs a roll of paper towels and a bottle of cleaner from under the counter and begins dabbing at his head like she's done this a hundred times. She probably has.

"You should go to hospital," she says, and it isn't a suggestion.

"Hospital is boring," he says, echoing the hostel's favorite excuse.

Marta makes a noise, wipes harder. "Boring is good," she mutters. "Boring is alive."

The guy's mates hover, awkward, eyes darting. Someone in the bar laughs too loud. The music keeps playing. Kuba pours a beer for someone like nothing is happening. The moment hovers and then dissolves.

I step back, my beer warm in my hand. The blood is only a thin line, a small cut, a nothing injury. But the copper smell rises anyway. It threads through the beer and sweat and detergent. My stomach clenches.

"See?" Liv says, sliding beside me. She nods toward the guy. "It's a lottery."

"And the house always wins," I say.

She looks at me. "You're quieter today. That's not like you."

"Maybe I'm growing up," I say, but it doesn't feel like a joke. It feels like a confession.

She nudges my shoulder. "Don't do it here."

"Do what?"

"Grow up," she says. "This place hates that."

I laugh because she wants me to, but my eyes are on the guy with the toilet paper, on the smear he's leaving on the chair, on the way the blood keeps trying to run. He tilts his head to the side like the world is suddenly slanted. He swallows and blinks slow.

"You okay?" his mate asks.

"Yeah," he says again. He smiles and the smile is a little off. He closes his eyes for a second and opens them like nothing happened.

I know that look. The look of pretending it's fine because the alternative is admitting you need help in a place that doesn't do help. I take a sip of beer, and it tastes sour.

Around midday, we go out to a cheap place for goulash because it's Wednesday and the hostel's "family dinner" is actually decent. The air outside is cold and damp. The city smells like smoke and bread. The river is a strip of pewter under the grey sky. I should feel grateful. I feel tired.

We sit in a long table. The bowls are steaming. The bread is thick and soft. I eat more than I meant to, the warmth settling in my stomach like a bandage. The noise around me is bright, laughter pinging off the walls. I laugh along. The beer on the table sweats. I drink it because it's there.

Mae nudges me. "You're quiet today."

"Just thinking," I say.

"About what?"

I think about the smear on the wall. I think about the pipe. I think about the way the floor tilts when I stand. "About going home," I say, and surprise myself.

She looks at me for a second, then nods. "Sometimes home is the only place that doesn't ask you to be someone."

I almost tell her about Mum. I almost tell her about the texts, the guilt, the way my chest hurts when I see my sister's face on my phone. I don't. I take another bite of bread instead.

"When do you go?" she asks.

"Soon," I say, and it sounds like every lie I've told myself for years.

We leave the restaurant and the cold bites my ears. The walk back is quick, our breath turning into fog. I slip once on a slick cobblestone. Mae grabs my elbow and steadies me. "You're a hazard," she says, and smiles, but her grip lingers.

Back at the hostel, the afternoon nap is a shared ritual. Bodies collapse on couches, chairs, the floor. The bar is quiet, the music low. I should sleep. I can't. The sleep in this place is never restful. It's a blackout, a surrender. I sit by the window with a coffee and watch the street. A couple walks past, holding hands, laughing. They look like they belong to a different city.

My phone buzzes. Mum again. I stare at the screen, then answer before I can think too hard.

"Bradley?" Her voice is soft, tired, full of worry.

"Hey, Mum."

"It's late there, isn't it?"

"Afternoon," I say. "Time zones are weird."

She laughs, a small sound. "I had a dream you were home. You were eating cereal. You hated cereal when you were ten."

"I was dramatic," I say, and my throat tightens.

"You still are," she says, and I hear the smile in her voice. "Are you okay? Really."

I look at the window. I look at the street. I look at the condensation on the glass. "Yeah," I say. "I'm okay. I'm just... tired."

She goes quiet for a second. "You can come home, love. You don't have to keep doing this."

The words hit like a punch and a hug. I swallow. "Soon," I say again. "Just... soon."

She sighs. "Promise?"

"Promise," I say, and the word tastes like rust.

We talk for another minute about nothing. About the weather. About the neighbour's dog. About my cousin's new baby. The normality is a comfort and a weapon. When I hang up, my hands are shaking again. I tuck the phone away like it's dangerous.

The afternoon drifts into evening. The hostel wakes up like it always does, like it's on a timer. Music starts. Lights warm. The air fills with the smell of beer and sweat. A themed night has been declared: "Wet & Wild Wednesday." The name is older than the joke. The courtyard tarp is back. Someone sprays water into the air. People cheer.

"You're not getting in the slip 'n slide today," Liv says, pointing a finger at me like she's the sheriff of bad decisions.

"Who died and made you responsible?" I ask.

"Nobody," she says. "Yet."

I laugh, but it feels sharp. "Fine," I say. "I'll supervise."

We stand by the tarp and watch people launch themselves across wet plastic. The sound is a slap and a howl. It's funny. It's stupid. It's a lesson no one wants. I hold a beer and try not to finish it too fast. I try to drink water between sips. I try to be good. The night laughs at me.

Someone sprays me with a bottle. The water is cold on my chest. It wakes me up for a second. I want to be awake. I want to feel the edges of things. Then the buzz comes back, warm and fuzzy. I let it.

At some point, a guy in a pirate hat slips off the tarp and skids into the side wall. He laughs, holds up his beer. "Safe as houses!" he yells, and the crowd roars.

Liv leans close. "You should eat something."

"I had goulash," I say.

"That was six hours ago."

"I'm not a machine," I say.

"You're trying to be," she says, and I don't have a comeback for that.

Later, the bar is full, the music loud enough to vibrate the ribs. The lights flash. The wall of polaroids looks like a flickering memory. I dance because it's easier than standing still. I drink because it's the only way to keep up. My head is a little clearer than yesterday, maybe because of the food, maybe because the fear has sobered me in a strange way. I keep touching the side of my head like it's a bruise I can't see.

In the bathroom upstairs, someone has taped a new sign next to the mirror: SHOWER SOBER. DON'T BE A HEADLINE. The marker is bold, the joke too close to the truth. Someone drew a skull wearing a shower cap. I laugh. I shouldn't.

I wash my hands and stare at the sign. The flickering light makes it strobe. The smear on the wall is still there, darker now, and the pipe glints. The drain gurgles like a throat. I feel the floor beneath me, slick and cold.

Mae walks in, her face pale, her hair damp. "You okay?" she asks, and her eyes flick to the sign.

"Yeah," I say. "Just washing up."

"This place is cursed," she says, half joking, half not.

"This place is a mirror," I say, and the words surprise me. Petr's voice in my head.

She nods slowly. "Don't let it show you the wrong thing."

"What is the right thing?" I ask, but she is already at the sink, splashing water on her face, avoiding my eyes.

I leave the bathroom without showering. The idea of the floor beneath me, the pipe above me, makes my stomach twist. I go back downstairs and drink another beer, because that's what you do when the ground feels unsteady.

Near midnight, the party shifts. People are sloppy now, sweat and laughter and the kind of closeness that feels like a net. I should go to bed. I should get water. I should call my sister. Instead I end up in the courtyard, sitting on a damp chair, watching the tarp glisten under the fairy lights. The air is cold on my skin. My head feels heavy, my eyes gritty.

Kuba steps outside with a cigarette, lights it, leans on the railing.

"You all right?" he asks.

"Yeah," I say. "Just tired of being a warning."

He exhales smoke. "We are all warnings. People just don't like reading."

I smile at that, then look at the wet tarp and the puddles around it. The water reflects the lights in broken stars. I imagine the bathroom floor, the way it gleams the same way. The line of water in the hallway. The pipe's dull shine. The smear on the wall.

"You going to shower tonight?" Kuba asks, like he can read my mind.

"Maybe in the morning," I say. "When I'm less smashed."

"That's always the plan," he says. He flicks ash into a plant pot. "Just remember the floor doesn't care."

I nod. The night doesn't care either.

I go upstairs. The dorm is half asleep, half buzzed. Someone is whispering to someone else. Someone is crying quietly in a top bunk, the kind of cry you pretend is just snoring. The shower is running down the hall, the hiss steady. It sounds like a reminder. I brush my teeth in the sink, look at my reflection in the cracked mirror. My eyes are bloodshot, but there's a spark there too, the spark I chase, the one that burns me.

I put the shower mat by my towel again. I set the broken sandals beside it, the knot I tied in the strap already loosening. I line them up like a ritual: mat, towel, sandals. A little altar to a better morning.

I lie down. The room leans. I let it. I close my eyes and hear the shower running, then stopping, then running again. The building breathes. The floor waits.

"Tomorrow," I whisper, and the word feels like a cliff edge.
