# Chapter 13: The Morning Tilt

The hallway swims when I step into it.

Not in the lazy hangover way, not in the fun spins that turn into stories, but in that sick tilt like the whole building is a boat and I'm the only one who can feel the waves. The green emergency light makes everything look like it's underwater. The line of water along the floor catches the glow and turns into a thin, bright river. I stand there with my towel and feel the blood in my ears.

"All good," I tell myself, because I have to say it out loud or I might decide it's not.

The bathroom door is open. The flicker inside is a heartbeat. I can hear water hitting concrete in one of the stalls. Someone's already in there. I think about turning around and going back to bed, about letting the spins settle before I stand on a floor that has already tried to eat me once. But the idea of crawling back into my bunk with the taste of beer and metal in my mouth feels worse than the spin. I need clean. I need water. I need to be anything but this.

I step forward, and my foot slides a centimeter on the damp hall. My shoulder brushes the wall. I laugh, because it seems safer than swearing.

"Morning, mate," I say to the bathroom like it's a person.

Inside, the air is warm and wet. The smell of mildew sits heavy and sweet, like a towel that never dried. The handprint on the wall is a ghost now, a brown smudge half erased, but I can still see the fingers. The copper pipe shines dull and indifferent above it. The light buzzes, flickers, steadies. The sink drips. The drain gurgles like it's thinking.

A guy is in the middle stall, humming under the water. He's older, maybe late twenties, with a tattoo of a compass on his calf. I recognize him from last night, dancing on a table, shirtless, chanting with the Brits. He's quieter now, the kind of quiet that comes with a morning you don't remember.

"Floor's a bastard," he says through the curtainless stall, like he knows why I'm here.

"Cheers," I say, and I sit on the toilet lid because my legs feel soft. The toilet lid is cold and slick, the kind of plastic that never feels clean. I take a breath and the air feels damp and thick in my lungs.

My phone buzzes in my pocket. I pull it out. Another message from Mum. Just a photo this time, a beach back home with blue sky and white sand and a sun that looks like it never gets hungover. The caption is a single word: Miss.

My thumb hovers. My vision blurs at the edges, little halos around the screen. I blink hard, and the halos fade. I tell myself it's just the light, just the flicker. I type, Miss you too. I don't hit send yet.

In the stall, the guy coughs. It's deep and wet. He spits on the floor and the spit makes a tiny splash. I hear the sound like it's right inside my head.

"You all right?" I ask.

"Yeah," he says, voice rough. "Just dizzy. Bloody floor." He laughs once, a short bark. "Should come with a helmet."

"We'd all look sick with helmets," I say. He snorts, and the water keeps running.

My head tilts again. The room seems to rock. I put my palm flat on the sink to steady myself. The enamel is cold and gritty. I take another breath and the smell of mildew and cheap soap makes my stomach flip.

"Just a shower," I whisper. "Just a shower."

I stand. The move is too quick. The world slides to the left. I grab the wall. My fingers find the grout lines, the rough little ridges between tiles. There's no grab bar. There is only damp paint and the pipe that sits at head height like a dare.

"You in?" the guy asks.

"Yeah," I say, even though I haven't moved.

He finishes. The water cuts off. The silence that follows is louder than the shower. He steps out, droplets running down his legs, hair plastered to his head. His eyes are glassy.

"Careful," he says, nodding at the floor as he passes me. "This place is cooked."

"Always is," I say.

He leaves. The door swings shut behind him. Now it's just me and the flicker and the pipe.

I step into the stall, and the floor feels slicker than yesterday. A thin film of soap coats the concrete, the kind that doesn't rinse away even with water. The drain is clogged again, a shallow pool already forming near the moldy corner. I stand with my feet spread, like I'm on a surfboard I don't trust.

I turn the water on. It spits cold, then too hot, then settles into a lukewarm stream. I put my head under it and close my eyes. The water hits my scalp and the pain in my temples sharpens, like someone's pressing thumbs into my skull. I open my eyes fast. The pipe is right there, inches from my head. For a second, in the flicker, I see it as a blade.

"Not today," I tell it.

I reach for the soap. My hand trembles just a little. I rub the bar between my palms, make a thin foam that smells like cheap lemon. I scrub my chest. I scrub my arms. I scrub like I can wash the night off my skin.

My vision blurs again, the edges of the stall going soft. The world narrows to the sound of water and the pulse in my ears. I lean my forehead against the wall, just for a second. The tile is cold. The pipe is so close I can feel its chill through the air.

"Come on," I say to myself. "Don't be a princess."

I rinse. I step back. My heel slides a fraction. My arms go out. My fingers graze the wall, wet and useless. My heart slams. I catch myself on the wall and stand still, breathing hard.

There's a moment where I can see it again: the slip, the rotation, the pipe. The image is sharp and bright, like a flash photo. Then it's gone.

"You're fine," I say, louder. My voice bounces off the concrete.

I turn the water off and stand in the dripping silence. The light flickers, making the wet wall pulse. My head throbs. The air feels heavy and sweet. I could stand here forever. I could lie down on the floor and let the water cool, let the spins settle.

Don't be dramatic.

I step out carefully. The floor outside the stall is just as wet. I towel off with small, precise movements. I keep my eyes on the floor. I keep my hands free.

At the sink, I look at myself in the mirror. My face is pale. My eyes are bloodshot. My pupils look too big. The bleached tips of my hair are darker when wet, like burnt straw. There's a faint bruise on my shoulder from something I don't remember. I open my mouth and the taste of beer and metal floods back.

I rinse my mouth. The water is cold and tastes like rust. I spit. The spit is streaked with pink. I stare at it. My gums feel sore. I tell myself I bit my cheek in my sleep.

When I step back into the hallway, the world tilts again. I grab the door frame. I breathe until it steadies. The line of water shines under the emergency light, thin and stubborn. Marta is at the far end with her mop, pushing the same wet line back and forth like she thinks she can erase the sea.

"Alive," she says without looking up.

"Still," I say.

She glances at me, eyes tired. "You should sit. You look like ghost."

"I'm fine," I say, because it's reflex.

She snorts. "All say fine. Then they fall."

"Not me," I say, and try to smile. It feels like a cracked mask.

I walk back to the dorm and my feet feel like they're made of rubber. The room is dim, the curtains drawn. A guy snores on the top bunk. Someone has left a half-eaten kebab on the floor, the smell of onion sharp in the stale air. I sit on my bunk, towel around my waist, and my head spins again. I lie back and stare at the underside of the bunk above me, where someone has scratched a message: MAD HOUSE OR MAD ME. The letters are jagged and uneven, like the person writing was shaking.

My phone buzzes again. My sister this time. A voice note. I press play and her voice fills the room, quiet and tired.

"Brad, Mum sent me that photo of the beach. She's pretending she's okay but she's not. You don't have to call if you don't want to, but at least text her back, yeah? And drink some water. Please."

I stare at the ceiling. The word please sits in my chest like a weight.

"Later," I whisper. I send Mum's message and add a heart so she knows I'm alive. I don't send anything to my sister. I know I should. I don't.

The dorm door bangs open and a gust of hallway damp enters with it. Liv appears, hair wild, eyes half closed. She looks at me, towel around my waist, and raises an eyebrow.

"You showered?" she says.

"Look at me being responsible," I say.

"How's the death trap?" she asks, yawning.

"Slippery. Pipe still wants my head. Standard," I say.

She sits on the edge of my bunk and stretches, a long slow cat stretch that makes her shoulder blades show under her shirt. "You okay?" she asks, quieter.

"Yeah," I say, which is what I always say.

She looks at me longer than usual. "You look... pale."

"I'm Australian," I say. "This is as pale as we get."

She snorts, then leans in and presses her forehead to my shoulder. "Come down for coffee. We need to be vertical or we'll rot."

We go downstairs. The bar is in morning mode: quiet, chairs still messy, music low. Kuba is behind the counter with a rag and a smile that doesn't reach his eyes. He slides me a glass of water without asking. It's become a ritual.

"You look like you fought the bathroom," he says.

"Bathroom won," I say, and drink. The water is cold and tastes like the sink. My stomach flips again.

"Maybe you should slow down," he says, not joking. It's rare for him.

"We all die anyway," I say, because it's the line. Because if I say anything else the room might hear.

He pauses, rag in hand. "Not today," he says.

Liv orders coffee and presses her forehead to the counter. She looks like she wants to crawl under it. Kuba hands her a mug and she wraps her fingers around it like it's a hand warmer.

"Walking tour again?" she asks.

"My legs are on strike," I say.

"Same," she says. She sips her coffee and makes a face. "Tastes like burnt regret."

A group of Brits stumble in, still wearing last night's wristbands. One of them has a bandage on his forehead, a fresh white strip with a pink halo. He flops onto a stool next to me and groans.

"Mate," I say. "What happened?"

"Shower," he says, as if it's a proper noun. "Bloody thing tried to brain me."

"Pipe?" I ask.

"Nah, wall. Floor went out. I was halfway down before I knew it." He taps the bandage. "Marta gave me this. Told me not to sue."

"You gonna?" Liv asks.

He laughs. "Sue a hostel? I'm on a fifty-euro a day budget. I'd rather die."

We laugh because it's funny. Because it's also true.

Kuba leans in. "You boys should wear helmets in there," he says.

"They'd kill the vibe," I say.

"Vibe is overrated," he says, then goes back to wiping the counter.

I go to the kitchen for something that might count as food. The counter is cluttered with pans and a half-melted block of butter. The fridge hums like it's about to die. I find a tub of yogurt with no label and a spoon stuck in it, and I decide against it. There are two bananas, both bruised. I peel one and take a bite. It tastes like sleep and regret.

At the sink, a girl I don't know is rinsing a cut on her knuckles. She has a black eye that's fresh, the skin puffy and purple. She looks at me like she wants to laugh and cry at the same time.

"Bathroom?" I ask.

"Stairs," she says. "Slipped. Landed on my pride."

She lifts her hands and the water running off them is pink. A little cluster of bandages sits on the counter, along with a bottle of cheap vodka someone left next to the dish soap. She wraps her knuckles and smiles like it's nothing.

"You should see the other guy," she says, and then she glances at the vodka and smirks. "Actually, there wasn't one. Just me and gravity."

"Gravity's undefeated," I say.

"Yeah," she says. "And that bathroom pipe looks like a referee."

She tosses the wrapper in the bin and leaves. I watch her go, the way she moves carefully on the wet tiles. I take another bite of banana. My stomach rolls.

Back in the bar, a couple of new arrivals are clustered around the shame board. One of them is a skinny guy with a camera around his neck, blinking like he's still in daytime mode. He turns to me with a grin.

"This place is legendary, yeah?" he asks.

"So they say," I tell him.

"We just checked in," he says. "Any tips?"

I could tell him to sleep. To drink water. To buy proper shower shoes. To avoid the third-floor bathroom like it's cursed. I could tell him the pipe is waiting and the floor is slick and the light flickers like a warning you can't hear. Instead I grin and say, "Don't fall in love."

He laughs and takes it as a joke. It is a joke. It isn't.

He goes upstairs with his towel over his shoulder, the same bounce I had the first week. I watch him go. I imagine the floor under his feet. I imagine his hand reaching for a grab bar that isn't there. My stomach tightens. I grab my water and drink.

An hour later, I follow Liv outside for air. The courtyard is slick with rain. The fairy lights are still on, a weak yellow glow that makes everything look tired. A guy in a hoodie is leaning against the wall, pale, eyes closed. He holds a plastic bag in one hand and a bottle of water in the other. His lips are bluish. He looks like he hasn't been warm in a long time.

"You all right, mate?" I ask.

He opens his eyes slowly. "Just need a minute," he says. "Too many shots."

"Same," I say, because it's easier than being the guy who asks again.

He lifts the water bottle and his hand shakes. The cap rattles against the plastic. He takes a sip and coughs, the sound thick. He sits down on the step and leans his head back. I catch myself watching his throat move as he swallows, the way his eyes close again like he's trying to sleep standing up.

Liv bumps my shoulder. "Let's go for a walk," she says. "We need daylight."

We go out into the rain because it feels like a dare. The streets are wet and glossy, the cobblestones shining. I pull my hoodie up and the fabric is damp against my hair. The cold air clears my head for a minute, the way a slap does.

We pass a pharmacy with a green cross blinking in the window. The sign hums. Inside, shelves of bandages and painkillers line up like tiny white bricks. A poster on the glass says BE SAFE IN THE BATHROOM in Czech and English, a smiling cartoon with a rubber mat. I stare at it too long.

"You want to go in?" Liv asks.

"For what?" I say.

"For you," she says. "You're rattling." She taps the side of her head.

"I'm fine," I say, and keep walking.

We stop at a kiosk that sells umbrellas and beer. The guy behind the counter is the same one from yesterday with the shower shoes. He grins when he sees me.

"Still alive," he says.

"Against the odds," I say.

He holds up a pair of black rubber sandals. "Today is good day to buy." He points at the sky, then at my feet. My thongs are damp, the strap loose. The sole is thin as paper. He makes a face like he's watching someone refuse a life jacket.

"Maybe tomorrow," I say.

"Tomorrow is always maybe," he says, and shrugs.

We walk on. The rain smells like wet stone and cigarettes. The city looks soft around the edges, blurred by water. My vision does the same thing, a slow soften at the edges that makes me blink until it clears. I tell myself it's the rain. I tell myself it's the hangover. I tell myself anything.

On a corner, a worker is hosing down a doorway, water sluicing along the gutter. The hose catches the light, the spray a bright line. The puddle on the street ripples with each step. I step around it and my foot slips on the slick stone. My stomach drops. I grab Liv's shoulder and steady myself. She looks at me, eyebrows up.

"You good?" she asks.

"Cobblestones are evil," I say.

"So are you," she says, and she smiles, but her eyes stay concerned.

We duck under an awning and watch the rain for a minute. A tram rattles past, the bell bright and sharp. A couple argues in Czech, their words like stones. The city keeps moving. We do too.

The bar fills slowly, the morning wave of hungover bodies. Someone puts on a playlist that's all soft indie songs, the kind you listen to when you want to pretend you're not in a hostel. The air smells like toast and stale beer. The shame board gets a new photo of a girl asleep under the pool table with a slice of pizza on her chest. We laugh. The day slips by in a slow, sticky way.

At noon, the first recovery beers appear like magic. A guy with a man-bun announces a tournament and claps his hands. The bar lights warm. The mood shifts. Liv looks at me, a question in her eyes.

"Just one," she says.

"Hair of the dog," I say.

We drink. The beer tastes like bread and forgiveness. It makes the spins soften at the edges. It makes the headache step back. It makes me feel like myself again, which is the most dangerous part.

After the second beer, I stand to go to the toilet. The room lurches. I grab the back of my chair. The edges of the room blur into soft light. I blink. The blur stays for a second too long.

"You okay?" Liv asks.

"Just stood too fast," I say.

She doesn't look convinced. "Maybe you should eat."

"I did," I say. "Toast."

She rolls her eyes. "Toast isn't food."

I smile like it doesn't matter. It does.

I make it to the bathroom on the ground floor, the cleaner one. The light is steady and the floor is dry. It feels like stepping into a different world. I pee, wash my hands, and stare at myself in the mirror again. My eyes look less wild now. The beer has smoothed the jagged edges. I splash water on my face anyway. The water here doesn't smell like rust. It tastes like a hotel.

Back at the bar, Kuba nudges a bowl of peanuts toward me. "Eat," he says.

"You're turning into my mum," I say.

"She'd probably prefer it if I was," he says.

That hits harder than it should. I pick up a handful of peanuts and chew. They taste like salt and old oil. I keep chewing.

Outside, the day is grey. Rain taps the windows like impatient fingers. The courtyard is slick. The fairy lights are still up from last night, a weak glow in the daytime. People smoke under the awning, their faces grey in the drizzle.

I sit at a table with Liv and a Dutch guy named Sander who is here because his mates dared him to stay a week in the "craziest hostel in Europe." He's already regretting it.

"So what's the worst thing you've seen here?" he asks, eyes bright.

"Last night," Liv says. "Guy tried to climb the roof. Petr tackled him like a rugby player."

"That's mild," I say. "I saw a guy asleep in the kitchen sink once."

"That's not death," he says, laughing.

"Give it time," I say. "Everything here gets a chance."

He laughs, but it fades quick. He glances up toward the stairs. "Bathrooms really that bad?" he asks.

"Third floor is cursed," I say. "Second floor is just gross."

He grimaces. "I slipped last night. Almost went down."

"We all do," Liv says.

He shivers. "It's like the floor wants you."

"It does," I say, because it feels true. I laugh to make it lighter. "It makes the best stories, yeah?"

He doesn't laugh back. He looks at his beer like it's the only safe thing in the room.

The afternoon drifts. We play cards. We watch people come and go. A tour group returns soaked and loud, dripping in the hallway. Marta mops the same line of water, her back bent, her face set. The building breathes around us, old pipes ticking, floorboards creaking.

At some point, I go upstairs to grab my hoodie. The third-floor hallway is damp again, the line of water back and shining. The bathroom door is open and the light inside flickers like a warning. I slow without meaning to. The smell of mildew creeps out, and something metallic underneath it.

I lean against the wall and the world tilts a little. I close my eyes until it passes. My mouth tastes like beer and copper. My stomach flips. I consider going into the bathroom to splash my face, but the memory of the stall and the pipe makes my throat tighten.

"Later," I say to the door, like it's listening.

Back in the dorm, I find my hoodie and sit on my bunk. The guy above me snores. I look at my phone and scroll through my camera roll. There's a photo from last night: me on a table, arms out, mouth open in a scream that could be joy or panic. I look at it for too long. I delete it. I don't know why.

My sister's voice note sits unread in the notifications. I tap it. The sound waves appear. I don't press play.

The room spins again, slow and gentle, like the bunk is floating. I lie back and stare at the scratched message on the underside of the top bunk. MAD HOUSE OR MAD ME. I trace the letters with my eyes until they blur.

I fall asleep for a while. When I wake, the sun has shifted and the room is a different shade of grey. My mouth is dry. My head is heavy. I sit up and the world tilts. I breathe until it steadies. The dorm is empty now, everyone downstairs for dinner or drinks. The silence feels too loud.

My phone buzzes again. Mum: Are you going out tonight? I stare at the message. I imagine telling her I'm going to stay in, take it easy, call my sister. I imagine her relief. I imagine myself actually doing that. It feels like a fantasy, like picturing someone else's life.

I type, Just a quiet one. I hit send. It is a lie I tell so often it feels like a prayer.

I stand and my legs wobble. I grab my towel. The thought of the shower returns, insistent now. The feeling of being sticky and stale. The need to rinse the day off. The thought of the pipe makes my stomach tighten. The thought of the water makes it loosen.

"Just be careful," I tell myself.

The hallway is empty. The line of water glistens. The bathroom door is closed now, the light flickering beneath it. I stand outside for a second, listening to the building breathe. I can hear faint music from downstairs, the bass a distant pulse.

I open the door. The smell hits first, mildew and cheap soap. The handprint is still there, almost gone, but I can trace the shape with my eyes. The pipe is there too, dull and waiting. The floor is wet, a thin sheen over the concrete. The drain gurgles with a slow, bored sound.

I stand in the doorway and feel the room tilt again. Just a little. Just enough. The water in the corner moves, a tiny ripple, as if the room is nodding at me.

"In and out," I say. "Quick."

I step inside.

The flicker of the light makes the pipe pulse. The mold near the drain is darker now, almost black. The floor feels like it could pull me in if I let it. I roll my shoulders, take a breath, and put my foot down.

The concrete is slick. I feel it immediately, the lack of grip, the way it wants to slide. My heart bumps once, hard. I keep my eyes on the wall. I keep my hands ready.

"Just a shower," I whisper.

I reach for the tap.

Behind me, a floorboard creaks in the hallway. A voice calls, "Brad?"

I freeze with my hand on the cold metal. The pipe glints in the corner of my vision.

"Yeah?" I call back, my voice echoing.

No answer.

The hallway creaks again. The flicker in the light makes the room stutter. I stand there, half turned, the cold tap under my palm, the slick floor under my feet, the pipe waiting at head height.

The water doesn't run yet. The silence stretches. My heart keeps time.

"One more minute," I tell myself.

The door behind me is still open. The line of water in the hall shines like a path. The pipe feels closer than it should. The floor feels thinner. The air smells like rust.

I take a breath and turn the tap.
