# Chapter 12: The Practice Fall

I almost fall before the water even hits me.

My foot skates on the slick concrete, a quick little slide that turns my stomach to ice, and my arms fly out like they're trying to catch a bus that's already left. My fingers slap the wall, find it wet and grainy and useless, and I do that dumb little shuffle people do when they pretend they meant to move like that. The shower sputters and wheezes as if it's laughing. The pipe is a knuckle away from my head, copper and cold and too close.

I freeze with my heart punching my throat. The stall is an aquarium without glass. Water drips from the exposed pipe above me, and the mold at my feet glistens like moss in a swamp. The drain gurgles, then burps out a bubble. The sound echoes off the concrete like a throat clearing.

"Okay," I say to no one, because saying it makes it smaller. "Easy, Brad. Easy."

I shift my weight carefully, testing the floor like it's a frozen pond. I tell myself I'm fine. I tell myself I'm sober enough for a shower. The bathroom light flickers, turns my reflection into a strobe. My head still swims from last night. The towel on the hook looks like a ghost. The handprint on the wall is a dark bloom, still there, a dried bruise. I don't look at it too long.

The water finally turns hot, then scalding, then lukewarm. I stand under it and let it hit the back of my neck. It should feel like relief. It feels like being punished slowly.

Through the curtainless stall, I hear the door creak open. Someone coughs. A voice that could be Marta, or could be anyone, says, "Brad?"

"Yeah," I call. My voice sounds small in the tile echo.

"Floor is bad," the voice says. "Careful."

"Got it," I say. I look down at my feet. They're already slipping, just a millimeter, like the floor has decided it owns me now. I press my toes into the concrete and pretend that's traction.

The water brings my headache to the surface like oil. I shut my eyes and let the noise fill me. When I open them again, the pipe is right there, at head height, a copper finger pointing toward my temple. Someone has scratched initials into it. Or maybe it's just rust. It feels like a warning either way.

"Nice," I tell it, and laugh. It comes out too loud. The laugh is the kind you make at a funeral when you can't help it.

I keep my hand on the wall for a second, palm flat, like that could stop me from becoming the handprint. The wall is cold even under the hot water. The concrete under my feet is slick with a film of soap and whatever else has soaked into it over the years. I think about the showers at Mum's place, the white tiles and the curtain that always stuck to my leg. I think about the way she'd bang on the door and say, "You're draining the hot water," and I'd say, "Two minutes," like a bargain. I never slipped there. I never felt like the floor wanted me.

Here, the floor feels hungry. It doesn't care if I'm careful. It doesn't care if I'm drunk. It doesn't care if I'm anything. It's just wet and worn and waiting.

I shut my eyes again and take a long breath. The water sounds like rain on a tin roof. I could be back on the Gold Coast if I tried hard enough, if I let the roar drown out the smell of mildew and the metallic bite in the air. For a second I almost believe it. Then the light flickers, the pipe glints, and I'm back in this concrete box with my heart thudding too fast.

I wash fast. Soap doesn't lather much in this water, just a thin white film. It smells like cheap lemon and old plastic. I rinse, ducking my head so the pipe can't get me, and step back onto the floor. My heel skates again. My hands go out. My palm slides on the wall and leaves a new wet streak just above the dried handprint.

For a heartbeat I can see it: me falling, me hitting the pipe, me on the floor with the water running. The image is so quick it feels like a blink, but it sits in my chest after, heavy and wrong.

"Nah," I say, because I have to. "Not me."

I step out, grab the towel, and wrap it around my waist. The floor outside the stall is just as wet. I hop like a drunk flamingo, trying not to make a new stain on the wall. The mirror over the sink catches my eyes: red, puffy, young, scared. I look away.

In the hall, the line of water has grown again, a shiny vein down the hallway. Marta is there with her mop, moving it back and forth like she's pushing the ocean away. She looks at me, then at my dripping feet.

"Alive," she says.

"For now," I say, and try to make it a joke.

She doesn't smile. "You are lucky boy."

"Luck's my thing," I say, and walk away fast, the towel rubbing damp against my hips.

A guy I haven't seen before stands by the bathroom door, towel over his shoulder, face half-asleep. He watches me shuffle past, eyes flicking to my wet footprints.

"Floor bad?" he asks, accent thick.

"Bit slippery," I say. "Just take it easy."

He nods, then glances at the pipe through the open stall, the copper jutting like a broken bone. "That thing looks like it wants to kill someone," he says.

"Nah," I say, because if I agree it becomes real. "It's just ugly."

"Ugly can still kill," he says. It's not a joke. He walks in anyway. I hear the shower start a minute later.

In the dorm, I dress quick. My singlet sticks to my skin; my shorts feel too tight. I can still feel the slick of the floor under my toes. I can still see the pipe near my head. I can still hear the tiny gasp I made when my foot went out from under me. I open my backpack and pull out a clean-ish pair of thongs. One strap is loose. I tell myself it's fine.

My phone buzzes. Mum again: "How's the weather?" I stare at it, thumb hovering. I type, "Cold but good. Just showered." I add a laughing face so she thinks I'm okay. The message feels like a lie. I send it anyway.

The bar downstairs smells like coffee and goulash and last night. Kuba slides a glass of water toward me, because he does that now, like he's my nurse. The water is clear and cold. I drink it in one go and feel it slosh in my stomach like a fish.

"You showered?" he asks, eyebrows up. "Brave."

"Mate, I'm invincible," I say.

"Everyone here says that," he says. He wipes the counter with a rag that might be cleaner than the floor but only just. "You almost slip?"

I laugh. "Nah. Just the normal dance."

"Normal," he says, and lifts a hand as if to bless me. "The shower is a rite. The pipe is the priest."

"You should put that on a T-shirt," I say.

He grins. "You'd buy it."

"I'd wear it to my funeral," I say, and we laugh because it's funny. Because if we don't laugh, it sounds too real.

Liv slides in beside me, hair in a messy bun, eyes two bruises of sleep. She orders coffee and presses her forehead to the counter.

"You look less dead than usual," she says.

"Had a shower," I say.

"Look at you, taking care of yourself," she says, and she says it like it's a joke, but her voice is soft.

"Don't get used to it," I say.

We sit and drink our caffeine. The bar comes alive slowly, like a creature stretching. A couple of Aussies drag chairs in, still wearing yesterday's wristbands. A Brit staggers to the kitchen and emerges with toast. Someone puts on music, low, like they're being polite to the hangovers.

The day is supposed to be a tour day. That's what the whiteboard says, in green marker and half-erased jokes. "Free walking tour 2PM!" with a smiley face. The idea of walking sounds like work. The idea of sitting still sounds worse.

I grab a plate of toast and wander toward the kitchen. The counter is cluttered with pans and a half-eaten bowl of cereal. A guy with a bandage wrapped around his forehead stands at the sink, splashing water on his face. He's maybe nineteen, baby-faced, looks like he should be at school not in Prague with a head wound. The bandage is already pink at the edge.

"You all right, mate?" I ask.

He snorts. "Yeah. Shower tried to take me out. Slipped, smacked the wall. Didn't even feel it till I saw the blood."

He taps the bandage. It's thick, more gauze than skill. The first aid kit sits open on the counter, red cross glaring. There are empty packets of alcohol wipes and a single safety pin.

"That's hectic," I say, trying to make it sound light. "You hit the pipe?"

"Nearly," he says. "Bloody thing's at head height. I reckon if I was taller I'd be in the hospital. Marta gave me this," he adds, and nods to the bandage.

I look at the kit and imagine it there on my own head, a strip of white against wet hair. I imagine the blood, the way it would run down into my eyes. I force a laugh. "Yeah, that bathroom's got a body count."

He grins, then winces. "You locals should sue."

"I'm not local," I say, and we both laugh because none of us are.

When he leaves, I linger at the counter. The first aid kit is open like a mouth. I glance at the tiny roll of gauze, the blister packs of painkillers. I take two ibuprofen and wash them down with cold tap water. The pills feel like pebbles in my throat. I tell myself it's responsible. I tell myself it's not.

So we go. We grab jackets, pull beanies down, step out into Prague's grey morning. The street air is clean and cold, a slap that makes me feel briefly alive. The cobblestones are damp. The gutters run with yesterday's rain. My feet feel wobbly in my loose thongs, but I tell myself it's just the uneven ground.

We join the tour near the clock. A guide with a red umbrella waves at the crowd. He tells us about kings and defenestrations and how this city has seen more death than all of us combined. I listen with half an ear. The other half is listening to my body: the thump in my head, the ache in my knees, the way my heart feels too fast for a slow walk.

A pigeon flaps low and my hands jerk up, automatic. Someone laughs. I laugh too, but my laugh is a little late.

"You all right?" Liv asks.

"Yeah," I say. "Just jumpy."

"You sure?"

"Just need a beer," I say, and she gives me the look, the one that says you always say that.

We cross a bridge. The river below is brown and thick, moving slow. The stone is slick with moss. I grip the railing and feel the cold metal in my palm. A jogger brushes past and my heel slips a little. My heart jumps. I tighten my grip.

"Careful," the guide says to the group, as if he's heard the sound of my foot sliding. "Prague eats the careless."

"Good thing I'm careful," I mutter, and Liv snorts.

The tour ends near a pub. The group disperses like a flock. We don't even pretend to be cultural tourists anymore. We walk straight into the pub because it's warm and because the smell of beer is like a promise.

"Recovery," Liv says, raising her glass.

"Recovery," I say.

The beer tastes like bread and relief. It smooths the jagged edges of my nerves. The chatter in my head goes quiet. The hangover becomes a memory.

Outside, the city keeps doing its thing. People in coats hurry along the street, their lives moving in straight lines. I watch a mother pull her kid's beanie down over his ears. The kid complains, the mother laughs. The sound hits me like a soft punch. My own mum used to do that, tug my beanie down as if it could block out the world. I haven't been a kid in years, but suddenly I want to call her and tell her I'm okay. I tell myself I'll do it after this beer. After the next one. After I get home. After after after.

Liv leans in, elbow on the table. "Why are you here, really?" she asks, voice low.

"For the party," I say. It's automatic.

"No," she says. "Like actually."

I open my mouth and something else almost comes out. I'm tired, so tired. I could say the truth: that I'm scared of going home, scared of being normal, scared that the party is the only place where I'm anyone. I could say I don't know how to stop. Instead I shrug and lift my glass. "To see Prague," I say, and we both know it's a lie.

She doesn't push. She just clinks her glass to mine. "Cheers, then," she says.

We leave the pub and drift through the afternoon like we're made of fog. The streets are wetter now, a fine mist hanging in the air. The Old Town Square is full of umbrellas and camera flashes. A street vendor is selling cheap rain ponchos and knockoff scarves. I stop at a kiosk with plastic sandals hanging from hooks, a wall of brightly colored thongs that look like toys. A laminated sign says SHOWER SHOES 150 CZK, SAFE FEET, SAFE LIFE. The guy behind the counter taps the sign and smiles.

"You need," he says. His English is broken but his grin is perfect.

I hold up my own thongs, the ones with the loose strap. "Already got 'em," I say.

He shrugs like I just refused a life jacket. "Then don't die," he says, and laughs.

I laugh too, because what else do you do with a line like that. We walk on. The sign stays in my head anyway, SAFE FEET, SAFE LIFE, like a fortune cookie you can't forget.

We duck under an awning when the rain gets heavier. A tourist couple argues in French. A busker plays a slow version of a pop song, the notes stretching like rubber. The city smells like wet stone and cigarettes. My stomach feels hollow. The beer is wearing off and the headache creeps back in, a dull nail in my skull.

At a corner, an old man sells postcards. One of them shows a medieval execution scene, men in hoods and a crowd watching. Prague is a city that remembers its deaths. We buy two anyway, because it's what tourists do. I write nothing on mine and stick it in my pocket.

By the time we get back to the hostel, the rain has soaked my hoodie. The lobby smells like damp coats. Marta has put a bucket under a leak by the stairs; it drips into it with a steady plink, plink, plink. The sound follows me up the steps.

On the third floor landing, I pause and lean against the wall, just for a second. The building feels like it's breathing through the pipes. My pulse is in my ears. When I straighten, my vision tilts and the hallway stretches. I blink until it snaps back into place. The bathroom door is open, the flicker of light inside like a signal. For a second, the copper pipe catches the light and looks like a needle. I swallow and keep walking.

By the time we get back to the hostel, the bar is already filling. Someone is setting up beer pong. The shame board has a new photo of a guy asleep under the staircase, face down, arms out like he fell from grace. The air is warmer. The hostel hums.

Kuba whistles at me. "You survive tour?"

"Prague didn't eat me," I say.

"Don't jinx it," he says.

I walk upstairs to grab my hoodie. The hallway is damp. The line of water is back, stubborn as a stain. The bathroom door is open, light flickering. I glance in without meaning to. The handprint is lighter now, a ghost of a hand. My own wet smear from this morning sits above it, barely visible.

Inside, someone is singing off-key. The shower sprays. The pipe gleams. For a moment, the spray catches the light and the pipe looks like a blade.

I keep walking.

In the dorm, I scroll through my phone. My sister has sent a voice message. I press play. Her voice fills the room, quiet and tired.

"Hey, Brad. Mum's been stressed. You should call her. Or at least tell her you're alive. You can't keep doing this forever, you know? It's getting old. Call me back. Love you."

She doesn't sound angry. That's worse. It feels like a hand on my chest. I stare at the screen after it ends, at the little line of sound waves like a heartbeat. I almost call her. I really almost do. Then someone yells from the hallway, "Beer pong starting!" and I tell myself I'll call her later, after one drink, after two, after the night.

Downstairs, the table is already crowded. The ping pong ball arcs through the air. Someone chants. I step in, grab a cup. The first shot hits and we roar. The second misses and we groan. The third is a clean sink and everyone screams. The noise washes over me, loud and warm. The anxiety in my chest dissolves into foam.

At some point, I realize I'm sweaty. I wipe my forehead and my hand comes away damp. I should drink water. I drink another beer instead because it's there. Because someone hands it to me. Because it's always easier to say yes.

The night rolls. We move from bar to basement. The bass in the cave is heavy enough to shake my ribs. People jump and spill and laugh. My head is light, my body loose. My feet stick to the floor with spilled beer and I feel oddly safe because at least the floor here is sticky.

On the stairs down, someone bumps me from behind. My foot misses a step and my stomach drops. I catch the railing and laugh it off, but my hand is shaking. The metal is cold and damp. The guy behind me slaps my shoulder and shouts "Sorry, legend!" as if that makes gravity optional.

In the basement, the air is warmer than skin. The walls sweat. The lights pulse red, then blue, then nothing. The music is loud enough to blur time. I dance, I shout, I forget the pipe for a while. Then I look up and see a damp stain on the concrete ceiling in the shape of a hand, and I can't breathe for a second. I drink to make it go away.

At the bar, someone passes me a shot of something green. I ask what it is. They say, "Don't ask." I drink it anyway. It hits my stomach like fire. The room tilts. I steady myself on the bar and laugh. The bartender throws me a water. I let it sit because I want the burn more than I want the calm.

Later, outside in the courtyard, a cold wind cuts through my sweat. I sit on a bench and light a cigarette I don't remember asking for. My hands shake just a little. The flame wobbles. A Czech guy with a shaved head sits across from me, eyes on the smoke.

"You shower today?" he asks out of nowhere.

"Yeah," I say. "Why?"

"Bathroom is cursed," he says. "Last summer, girl hit head on pipe. Broken cheek. They still didn't fix."

"It's fine," I say, because that's what I always say.

He shrugs. "Fine until not." He flicks ash into a beer cup and walks away.

In the middle of a song, the lights cut for a second. In that second, I see it: the shower, the pipe, the handprint. It's a flash, a memory that doesn't feel like a memory. My heart jumps. Then the lights strobe back on and someone slaps my back and I laugh it off.

"You okay?" someone shouts in my ear.

"Never better!" I shout back.

The night ends like it always does: with us sprawled in the common room like the aftermath of a small war. Someone is asleep in a beanbag. Someone is whispering into their phone. Someone is crying softly on the couch. I sit on the floor with my back against the wall and take my shoes off, because my feet hurt and because the air feels thick.

Liv drops beside me, head on my shoulder. Her hair smells like smoke and shampoo. She closes her eyes.

"Did you call your sister?" she asks without opening them.

"Not yet," I say.

"You should," she says.

"I will," I say, and I hate how automatic it feels.

She shifts, curls closer. "Promise?"

"Promise," I say. I want to mean it. I don't know if I do.

We sit like that for a while, the music from upstairs a distant thump. Somewhere, someone drops a glass and it shatters. The sound makes me flinch.

"You're jumpy today," Liv says.

"Just tired," I say. "Long day."

"Maybe you should slow down," she says. She says it like she knows the words will bounce off.

"Sleep when I'm dead," I say, and she laughs, but she doesn't smile.

Around four, I drag myself upstairs. The hallway is dark except for the green emergency light. The wet floor sign is upright now, a triangle of warning. The line of water has thinned but not gone. I step around it, not trusting my own feet.

The bathroom door is closed. The light flickers under it. I stand there with my hand on the handle. My mouth is dry. My head floats. The idea of a shower feels both dangerous and necessary. The thought of that morning slip turns in my stomach.

"Not now," I whisper. "Morning." The words taste like superstition.

Back in the dorm, I climb into my bunk and lie on my back. The ceiling is a grey blur. The room is full of quiet breaths and the occasional snore. My head still spins. I close my eyes and see the pipe, the handprint, the wet floor. My heart stutters. I roll onto my side and clutch my pillow like a life raft.

My phone buzzes. A text from Mum: "Miss you. Stay safe." I stare at it until the screen dims. I type, "Love you" and hit send. The word feels too small for everything it carries.

Sleep comes in waves, each one washing the room away and bringing the shower back. In the dream, I step into the stall and the floor tilts. The pipe grows like a tree. I reach for a grab bar that isn't there. I wake with my hand in the air, fingers clenching nothing.

In the grey morning, my mouth tastes like beer and metal. My head is a drum. I sit up and the room spins. The guys in the bunks are still out, their mouths open, their breaths slow. The bucket in the corner is full again. I swing my feet down and they find the cold floor. My toes curl, trying to grip. The shower is calling, a steady drip beyond the door.

I grab my towel. I grab my clean thongs. I stand in the doorway and look down the hallway. The line of water gleams like a path. The bathroom light flickers, steady then not. My head hums. My stomach flips.

"Just a shower," I tell myself. "Just a shower."

I step out into the hall.
