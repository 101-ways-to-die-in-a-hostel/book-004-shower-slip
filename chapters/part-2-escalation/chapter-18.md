# Chapter 18: The Wet Night

The shower is still running.

It has been running long enough to become part of the building's breath. A steady hiss behind the dorm wall, the kind of white noise that should be calming but isn't because water means danger in this place. I roll over, shove my face into the pillow, try to ignore it. The sound keeps cutting through like a needle.

"Oi," someone murmurs from a bunk across the room. "Tell the shower to shut up."

"Tell yourself," I mumble back. My tongue feels like old felt. I sit up and the room tilts left, slow and lazy. The sandals Kuba gave me are by my towel, one strap loose like a tooth that wants to fall out. I swing my legs over the side of the bunk and the floor is cold in the way that tells you it's been wet.

The shower keeps running.

If I let it keep going, someone will be yelling in the morning about the water bill and Kuba will make a joke about the pipe crying. If I go check, I have to stand on that floor, with my thin thongs and my wet feet and my head full of bees. Either way, I lose.

"I'm on it," I say to nobody and grab my towel like a shield.

The hallway is dim and damp, that green emergency light making everything feel like a swimming pool at midnight. The line of water still snakes along the tiles, a pale vein. I step over it and my foot skates a fraction, enough to put my heart in my throat. I steady myself on the wall. The plaster feels cold and slightly greasy, like the building is sweating.

The bathroom door is ajar. The light flickers. The hiss of the shower grows louder, sharper, the sound of a storm trapped in a stall.

"You good in there?" I call, leaning in.

No answer. Just water.

I push the door open with my shoulder. The room is steam and mildew, the air heavy with cheap soap. The sound bounces off the tiles and makes the small space feel too small. The second stall from the left is closed. The curtain clings to a body inside, the outline slumped low.

"Hey," I say, louder. "Mate, water's been on forever. You alive?"

A grunt. Then a laugh, soft and wet. "Yeah, yeah. I'm all right. Just... dizzy." The accent is English, London maybe, the kind that makes everything sound half amused.

"You need a hand?"

"Nah," he says. "Just a minute. Floor's a bloody ice rink."

"You're not wrong." I glance at the tiles. The handprint stain from last week is faded to a rusty ghost. The drain is clogged again, water pooling and swirling toward it like it can't decide where to go. The copper pipe in the second stall sticks out of the wall like a blunt finger, right at head height. It catches the flicker of the light and gleams.

I step closer, careful, my thongs squeaking on the slick. The floor sucks at the rubber. The pull is tiny but insistent, like the room is trying to hold my feet.

"You in the second stall?" I ask.

"Yeah," he says, breathless. "Someone nicked my flip-flops, so... barefoot adventure." He laughs again, the kind of laugh you do when you're trying to assume you're fine.

I put my hand on the tile to steady myself and feel the slime of soap residue under my palm. My fingertips slide a little. The guy inside shifts and the curtain makes that sticky slap against his skin.

"Don't stand up quick," I say, and it comes out like a warning I wasn't planning to give. "You'll go arse over." I glance at the pipe again. It's so close to where his head is, too close.

"Mate, I've done worse," he says, and I hear the shrug in his voice.

"Have you?" I look at the pipe. I picture a skull against copper. It isn't a nice picture.

He sits for another minute, water still running cold on his shoulders, then says, "All right, here goes," and I hear the scrape of skin on tile as he shifts. The curtain parts a little and I see his foot search for traction, toes white and wrinkled from water. He wobbles. He flings his arm out and catches the wall.

"Whoa," he says, laughing. "Bloody deathtrap."

"Yeah," I say. "That one." I take a step back to give him room and my foot skates. Just a fraction. A heartbeat. My hand shoots out and slaps the sink, fingers slipping on enamel. The edge digs into my palm. The floor tugs at my thong like a bad joke.

"You all right?" he asks, more alert now.

"All good," I say, because that's what I always say. "Just... slippery."

He finally stands, half in, half out of the stall. He's pale, twenty-something, with a bruise on his cheekbone. His hair is plastered to his head. He blinks at me like he's just arrived in the room.

"Cheers," he says. "I thought I was going to sleep in there."

"Could do worse," I say. "There's a rage cage." I nod toward the door.

He laughs and shuffles out, leaving wet footprints that join the line in the hallway. The shower is still running. I reach in, twist the handle. It squeals like it's annoyed, then shuts off. The silence is too big after the rush.

I stand there a second longer, listening to the pipes tick as they cool. The light flickers in tired pulses. The pipe catches the light again. I touch the side of my head, just above my ear, and imagine how it would feel to hit that. A dull thud. A bright spark. I shake it off.

"I'm not going to fall in the shower," I tell the room. The room doesn't answer.

Back in the dorm I fall into bed with my towel still in my hand. The shower has stopped. The building settles. I close my eyes and the pipe is still there in the dark, a thin line in my mind.

---

Morning in Mad House is a joke with bad timing. It starts too late and feels too early. The air in the dorm is stale and damp, like a sock you forgot in the laundry. I wake to the sound of someone retching in a bucket and the smell of beer sweating out of skin. My head is a kettle left on the stove.

The sandals are still by my towel. One strap is looser now, stretched from something, someone. I pull them on anyway, the rubber warm from the air. I check my phone. Three messages. Mum: Call when you can. Sister: Please answer. Liv: Recovery beers at noon. The last one is the easiest to reply to. I type a thumbs-up.

When I sit up, the room swims. I blink. It settles. I stand and the floor tilts just a degree too much. I steady myself on the bed frame. My mouth is dry as dust. My tongue tastes like copper and last night's tequila.

The hallway is wet again. It is always wet. Marta is at the far end with her mop, the same tired circle, the same tired face. She looks up as I pass.

"You close shower?" she asks.

"Yeah," I say. "Guy fell asleep in there."

She snorts. "Everyone sleeps in there. Shower is warm. Floor is cold. Life is in between."

"You should put that on the wall," I say.

She doesn't smile. She drags the mop and the water just moves from one tile to the next, like it's playing a game it always wins.

In the bathroom, the air is colder than the dorm but wetter. The mirror is fogged. The handprint stain is almost gone, just a shadow now. The pipe is still there. The second stall is empty. I keep my sandals on and wash my face in the sink instead of showering. The water is cold and honest. I look at my reflection and the eyes looking back are too bright, like they belong to someone else.

Downstairs, the bar is in its morning slump. The lights are low, the chairs crooked. Kuba slides a glass of water toward me before I can ask. He always does. I drink it in three gulps. It tastes like metal and relief.

"You look like a man who tried to wrestle a river," Kuba says.

"The shower's still trying to drown people," I say.

He shrugs. "The shower is consistent." He pours himself coffee. The smell is burnt and strong. "We had a review last night. Filip says no more complaints about the bathroom. So Marta put a new sign up." He points toward the stairwell.

I follow his gaze. On the wall by the stairs, someone has taped a piece of paper with a thick marker scrawl: SHOWER AT YOUR OWN RISK. It looks like a joke until you remember it isn't.

"Safety sorted," I say.

"Always," Kuba says, and sips his coffee like it might contain answers.

Liv slides into the seat beside me and groans. "The world is too bright," she says.

"The world is fine," I say. "We are the problem."

"Speak for yourself," she says, but her smile is thin. She looks at my sandals. "Those going to disintegrate soon?"

"They're hanging on," I say, and lift my foot to show the loose strap. "Like me."

She laughs and then touches her temple. "My head is trying to escape."

"Join the club," I say.

A new group shuffles in, still with backpack straps on, faces bright and clean. One of them sees the sign on the stairs and laughs. He turns to his friend. "Welcome to Mad House," he says, like it's a punchline. I want to tell him it's not. Instead I raise my water in a mock toast.

Around noon, the bar fills with the slow tide of hungover bodies. Recovery beers appear like medicine. I tell myself I'll drink water first. I have a beer instead. The first sip is warm and the bitter taste makes my stomach curl. The second sip makes it settle. It's a sick kind of comfort.

"You coming on the walking tour?" Mae asks, dropping into a chair across from me. Her hair is still damp, freckles bright against her pale skin. "Free shots."

"Free anything is my religion," I say.

She grins. "Then we leave in ten."

The walking tour is a snake of damp jackets and loud guides. The city is cold and pretty, the kind of cold that makes your skin feel clean. The guide tells us about defenestrations and rebellions, about people tossed out windows, about how Prague loves a fall. We laugh because it's history, because it's far away. I keep looking at windows.

We stop at Old Town Square. The Astronomical Clock shows a parade of saints I don't recognize. Tourists lift their phones and the bells chime. I feel a flutter behind my eyes, the world sliding slightly to the left. I grip the edge of a stone planter until it passes.

"You all right?" Mae asks, leaning in.

"Yeah," I say. "Just a sway." My voice is light, but my fingers are white on the stone.

She offers me a bottle of water. I take it and drink. It tastes like nothing. The nothing is nice.

The guide leads us to a bar for the promised shots. He tells us the rule: the bar is only free if you tip the bartender. The shots line up like little amber teeth. I take mine. The alcohol burns and the world sharpens, then softens again. It's a seesaw I know too well.

We stagger back to the hostel in the late afternoon, the city glittering cold around us. The cobblestones are slick from a thin drizzle. My foot slips once and I catch myself, heart thumping. Mae laughs and says, "You're clumsy today." I laugh too, because it sounds better than the truth.

Back at Mad House, a stack of new shower mats sits by reception. Thin rubber squares with a smiley face punched into them. Kuba is putting them into a cardboard box marked LOST AND FOUND like they're already lost.

"We got mats?" I ask.

"We got a box," he says. "Filip bought them because a review called us 'a lawsuit with bunk beds.'" He knocks the box. "They'll go missing by tomorrow."

I pull one out and feel the rubber. It's thin, cheap, but it has little suction cups on the back. It smells like a new car and a lie.

"How much?" I ask.

He waves his hand. "Take one. Consider it your tip for not drowning last night." He pauses. "Put it in the stall if you want. Just know someone will take it as soon as you turn your back."

I stare at the mat. It's ridiculous that a ten-euro piece of rubber feels like a lifeline. I tuck it under my arm.

"This place is a natural selection experiment," I say.

Kuba smiles without teeth. "We are all passing or failing together."

I carry the mat upstairs and shove it into my locker like it's contraband. The dorm is quiet, all the beds empty, everyone out chasing the next drink. I open my phone and see my sister's messages again. I type, Busy, but I'm alive. Miss you. I stare at the words and delete them. I type, All good, talk soon. It's the same lie, but shorter.

The mat feels heavier than it should, like a decision. I pull it back out, take it with me to the bathroom. If I'm going to have it, I might as well use it. The hallway is still damp, the green light making the wet shine. I keep my eyes down, watching the line of water like a thin rope laid across the floor.

Inside, the bathroom is empty for once, the kind of emptiness that makes every drip sound like a shout. The light flickers, the pipe gleams, the drain gurgles to itself. The air smells of bleach and mildew and the faint copper tang of old blood. I choose the second stall because that's the one that scares me, the one I want to fix.

The concrete floor is rough where the tiles used to be, speckled with mold like a rash. I unroll the mat and press it down. The suction cups meet the concrete and do nothing. I push harder. Nothing. The mat slides a centimeter, slow and useless.

\"Come on,\" I mutter, and try again. The floor is too uneven, too gritty. The mat lifts at the corners like it wants to leave. It doesn't belong here. It doesn't want to belong here.

\"You trying to tame it?\" a voice says behind me.

I turn and nearly bump into a guy with a towel around his shoulders. He looks older than the rest of us, maybe late twenties, a local or a long-term drifter. His hair is dark and damp, his eyes tired. I recognize him from the courtyard the other night, the one who said the edge is fine until you go over. He watches the mat with mild amusement.

\"Yeah,\" I say. \"Thought I'd make it less murdery.\"

He snorts. \"That floor eats mats. It eats feet too.\" He nods at the pipe. \"Watch your head.\"\n+
\"It's fine,\" I say, and the words come out automatic. I press the mat again, like if I push hard enough the world will comply.

He shakes his head. \"They should tile it. Or at least put something real.\" He gestures at the concrete. \"This is old. Slippery when wet. Always wet.\" He looks at me. \"You are here long time, yes?\"\n
\"Couple of weeks,\" I say.\n
\"Then you know.\" He shrugs. \"You know and you still come.\"\n
\"It's a hostel,\" I say. \"It's meant to be a little dodgy.\"\n
\"Dodgy is a broken lamp,\" he says. \"Dodgy is a chair that wobbles. This is dangerous.\" He says it without drama, like he's describing the weather.

\"You're the third person to tell me that,\" I say, trying for a laugh.\n
He doesn't laugh. \"Maybe you listen to the third one.\" He steps into the stall beside me and turns the shower on. Cold water hits the concrete, splashes my ankles. The mat shifts again. The suction cups skitter on the wet surface. It might as well be a plastic placemat.

\"Maybe I just have to be careful,\" I say. I can hear the plea in my own voice. It's the kind of logic you use when you can't change the thing.\n
\"Careful is good,\" he says. \"Careful is not a mat.\" He closes the curtain. The shower takes up the whole stall, the water spraying sideways because the head is clogged. It hits the pipe and sprays a fan of cold against the wall. The sound is loud and sharp, like someone hissing.

I crouch and press the mat down one last time. The concrete is cold under my palm. The suction cups do nothing. I stand, pick up the mat, and shake it once like it offended me. The water on it scatters in a fine spray. It looks pathetic, this flimsy square, like a warning label you can't stick anywhere.

\"I'll put it in a different stall,\" I say, not sure to whom. The guy doesn't answer. The curtain is closed and the water roars. The pipe is a line in the corner of my eye, the dull copper tooth, the thing you only notice when you can't stop noticing.

I move to the far-left stall, the one with a bit more tile. The suction cups grab for a second, then slide as the water from the other stall creeps over the threshold. I press and hold until my arms ache. It sticks for a moment, then the top corner peels up like a lip. I let go. The mat settles crooked, half attached, half drifting.

\"Good enough,\" I say, even though it isn't.

On the way out, I leave the mat leaning against the sink while I wash my hands. A moment later, a couple of new arrivals barrel in, laughing, towels over their shoulders. One of them points at the mat. \"Oh sick, free mat,\" he says. He grabs it like it's a prize.\n
\"Hey,\" I say, but it's soft, and his friend is already laughing and tugging him into a stall.

I stand there for a beat, my mouth open, then close it. The mat is gone. The decision is gone. It's ridiculous, but my chest tightens anyway.\n
\"Told you,\" Marta says from the doorway. She has appeared without me hearing her, mop in hand like a staff. She looks at the empty spot by the sink and shakes her head. \"This place eats rubber.\"\n
\"Apparently it eats hope too,\" I say.\n
She doesn't smile. \"Hope is not on the cleaning schedule.\" She passes me with her mop and starts pushing water again, like the room is a chalkboard she has to erase every day.\n
I leave the bathroom with wet hands and no mat, feeling stupid for thinking a piece of rubber could do anything in a place like this.

On the way back down I run into Petr on the stairs. He looks tired, eyes half-lidded. He nods at the mat under my arm.

"Good idea," he says. "They should put those in every stall."

"They won't," I say.

He shrugs. "We are a hostel, not a hospital."

"Feels like we should be both," I say.

He laughs, a short bark. "No one wants to party in a hospital."

We pass a guy wearing a neck brace like a fashion accessory. He grins at us. "Bathroom souvenir," he says, and taps the brace. The grin is too big. I nod and keep walking.

---

By night, the hostel has grown a second skin. The bar is warm, the lights are yellow, the air thick with sweat and music. It's themed night again, some kind of "wet and wild" nonsense that means cheap spray bottles and a plastic tarp in the courtyard. Someone hangs a banner that says SLIP 'N SIP. Someone else tapes a caution sign to it like it's the punchline.

"You're not getting in that, are you?" Liv asks, watching the tarp go down.

"Me? Never," I say. A minute later I'm in it, sliding across wet plastic with a beer in my hand, laughing because it's a good laugh and because not laughing feels like letting the fear win.

The tarp is slick as ice. People take turns running and skidding, tumbling into each other in a mess of bodies and cheap cider. Someone starts a chant. Someone spills beer and no one cares because it's all beer anyway. The sound of bodies hitting wet plastic is a slap, a soft humiliation. I go twice more because my head is quiet on the slide.

At one point I stand up too fast and the world tilts. The courtyard swings like a carnival ride. I grab the edge of the tarp and wait for it to settle. Liv sees me and raises her eyebrows.

"Sit down," she says.

"I'm fine," I say.

"That's what everyone says before they aren't." She says it like a joke, but her eyes stay on me, steady.

I take a breath, straighten, and go back to the bar. The music is louder inside, the bass a pulse you can touch. I drink because the bass demands it. I laugh because the room is laughing. I dance because my body is still mine and it doesn't always feel that way.

Later, when the night is a blur, I find myself in the kitchen, leaning against the counter with a plastic cup of water. The goulash pot is empty. The sink is full of beer cans. A wet-floor sign leans against the fridge like a drunk who gave up on standing.

Mae stumbles in, hair plastered to her forehead. "I think I'm done," she says, and collapses onto a chair.

"You're done when the sun says you're done," I say, and she flips me off without lifting her head.

My phone buzzes. Another message from Mum. Another from my sister. I ignore them both because I can't stand the weight of them tonight. I tell myself I'll reply in the morning, when I'm a better version of me.

At three, the party thins. People collapse in piles, giggling. The courtyard empties. The tarp sits wet and wrinkled like a shed skin. I trudge upstairs, my sandals squelching. The strap on the left one finally gives and snaps with a sad little sound. The loose piece flops against my foot.

"Of course," I say to the empty hallway. The line of water is still there, still shining. I step around it and my foot catches anyway. I windmill, grab the wall, steady. I laugh into the quiet because it's easier than being angry at the building.

In the dorm, I peel off my wet clothes and toss them into a heap. The broken sandal goes next to the towel. I stare at it. It looks like a mouth missing a tooth. I should go down to reception and ask for another. I don't want to deal with Kuba's look. I don't want to admit I need help for something as stupid as a shower.

I pick up the shower mat from my locker and unroll it on my bed. The rubber is cold and tacky. I run my thumb over the suction cups. It's ridiculous that I'm spending this much energy on a square of rubber, but it feels like a talisman.

"Tomorrow," I tell the mat. "We do it properly." I fold it and put it by my towel and the broken sandal. A little pile of promises.

I climb into bed. The room spins gently, a slow carousel. In the bunk across from me, a guy whispers into his phone, a soft "I miss you" that sinks into the sheets. Someone snores. Someone laughs in their sleep. The building hums around us.

The shower turns on down the hall. The sound fills the space, the same hiss, the same steady rush. I close my eyes. The pipe is in my mind again, a copper grin. The mat is by my bed. The sandal is broken. The water keeps running.

"Tomorrow," I whisper, and the word feels thinner than it should.
