# Chapter 17: The Safe Option

The shower shoes are gone.

I know because the plastic bag is still on my bunk, crumpled and light, like someone took the only thing that mattered and left the wrapper as a joke. I sit up and the room tilts, not a spin, a slow roll like a ship. The bag rustles when I touch it. It smells faintly of new rubber and old beer.

"Did anyone nick my shower shoes?" I ask the room, but the room is asleep and the room doesn't care.

A guy with a duvet over his head mumbles something. The bunk above me creaks as someone turns over. The air is thick, warm with bodies, stale with sweat. The morning light is weak and grey. I feel the last of last night sitting in my stomach, sour, heavy. My mouth tastes like coins.

I should laugh. I should assume I misplaced them. I should make a joke about the hostel eating everything that's sensible. But my chest tightens instead, a small clench, because those shoes felt like a promise. Because I bought them with the kind of seriousness I pretend not to have. Because I told myself the story of the person who takes care. The hostel has a way of stealing stories as quickly as it steals shoes.

I stand and the floor wobbles. I grab the bed frame to steady. The metal is cold. The room breathes around me. I do the inventory in my head: towel, toothbrush, phone. Shoes, no. Thongs, yes, thin as paper. They look like a punchline when I hold them up.

"Good enough," I say. It doesn't feel like it is.

In the hallway, the line of water is there, shining in the emergency light like a thin warning. The air is colder than the dorm, damp. I step carefully. My thongs squeak on the slick floor, the rubber fighting the water but not really winning. The bathroom door is open. The light flickers in tired pulses. The sound of the shower is off, thankfully, but the floor is wet anyway, like it doesn't know how to be dry.

Marta is in there, mop in hand, hair tied back tight. She looks at me like I'm a stain.

"Shoes," she says, and her voice is a tired command.

"They're... gone," I say, and spread my hands like I'm showing her the theft.

She makes a sound that could be a laugh if she had more faith in people. "Then you take your chances. Or you go to ground floor. That one is safer. Slightly." She says slightly like it's a joke and a warning in one.

"I'll go down," I say. The words taste like doing the right thing.

She nods and keeps mopping. The mop pushes the water around in a slow circle, never really getting rid of it. The wet smell is stronger today, mildew and bleach and the faint copper tang that makes my teeth ache.

I head down the stairs, one hand on the sticky rail, the other holding my towel like a flag. The stairwell is a narrow throat covered in graffiti. Someone has written DIE YOUNG over a poster for a pub crawl. Under it, someone else wrote OR DIE CLEAN in a different marker. I snort. The wall jokes like it wants to be in on it.

The ground-floor bathroom is technically for staff and guests who request it. It's in the back corridor, by the laundry room, and it smells like detergent instead of mold. I find it locked. A handwritten note on the door says CLEANING, BE BACK SOON. The paper is old, the tape curling. It could have been there for days.

I knock anyway. No answer. The pipe behind the wall ticks. The building breathes. The corridor is empty and cool, and I can hear the bar waking up in the distance, stools scraping, a low hum of music.

"Of course," I say to the door. The safe option is always closed.

I go back up. Each step feels like a question and each answer is the same. The line of water on the third floor looks thicker now. The light flickers. The bathroom door is open and empty. The stall is waiting.

I stand in the doorway and let the hesitation ride over me. The thongs on my feet are damp and thin. The floor looks like ice. The pipe in the second stall is a dull copper tooth, a slow grin.

"Just a rinse," I say.

I take the far-left stall, the one with slightly more tile. I keep my hands on the wall. The water is cold at first, then warm, then hot. It beats down on my shoulders, presses the noise in my head into a duller hum. I close my eyes for a second and the darkness behind them swims. When I open them, the world is a fraction of a beat behind, like my eyes are lagging. It's just a hangover, I tell myself. Standard. Nothing.

I wash quickly. I step carefully. The water pools around my toes because the drain is slow. The smell of soap is lemon and lies. The mold in the corner is dark and soft like velvet. I finish fast and turn the tap off. The silence after is too big.

As I step out, my foot slides a hair. My stomach drops. I catch the wall with wet fingers, the tiles slick, the grout rough. It isn't a fall. It isn't even a slip. It's a whisper of one. I breathe out and pretend I don't feel my heart racing.

"I'm fine," I tell the room. The room doesn't answer.

I dry off and hurry back to the dorm before the floor can decide to prove a point. The bag with the missing shoes sits on my bed like a joke I told myself. I toss it in the corner and pull on a cleanish singlet and shorts. My reflection in the mirror looks thin around the eyes. The bruise on my shoulder has darkened. The skin under my eyes is grey. I grin at myself, and the grin looks like a crack.

Downstairs, the bar smells like toast and detergent. Kuba is behind the counter, shirt wrinkled, eyes tired. He slides a glass of water toward me without a word.

"Ground floor is closed," I say.

"It is always closed," he says. "We should put a sign that says this is the safe shower and then keep it locked to save people the trouble of deciding."

"Someone nicked my shower shoes," I say.

He whistles low. "Here, people steal anything that looks like a choice." He reaches under the bar and pulls out a plastic basket of lost-and-found: mismatched socks, a broken charger, a single flip-flop, a bra. He rummages and holds up a pair of cheap blue rubber sandals, one missing a strap. "All I can offer." He shrugs. "They were free to begin with."

I take them anyway. The rubber is thin, but it has some grip. It smells like someone else's feet.

"You are accumulating warnings," Kuba says, like he's giving me a fortune.

"I'm accumulating sandals," I say.

He smiles but his eyes don't. He glances toward the stairs where the hallway starts. "Marta said someone fell last night. Broke his wrist. He was drunk, of course. He says the floor did it." He shrugs. "The floor always does it. It is an equal-opportunity menace."

"Did he go to hospital?"

"He went to bed. The hospital is boring," Kuba says. He wipes the counter like he's wiping the idea away.

I sit at a table and drink the water. It tastes like metal and relief. Liv drops into the chair across from me, hair up, eyes puffy.

"You look like a wet ghost," she says.

"I took the safe shower," I say.

"The safe shower doesn't exist." She sips her coffee. "Did you at least use the shoes?"

"They grew legs," I say.

She laughs, then stares past me. "This place eats anything decent. You either laugh or you cry." She shrugs. "We have a party to host tonight, so..." She gestures with her mug like a toast.

"What theme?"

"Something stupid," she says. "They want us to dress like lifeguards."

I picture red shorts, whistles, people screaming in a pool that doesn't exist. I laugh and it comes out too loud. A couple of new arrivals glance over, eyes wide. They look clean. They look hopeful. They'll learn.

Around noon, the bar fills in that slow hungover crawl. People drift in like sleepwalkers. Someone sets up beer pong. Someone turns on a playlist that sounds like a hangover regret montage. The air hums with low conversations and the clink of glass.

My phone buzzes. Mum again. I open it, then close it. The guilt is a small, sharp thing in my chest. It feels like a pebble you can't spit out.

A German guy with a forearm cast sits at the end of the bar. He's telling a story with big gestures, even with one arm. I hear "bathroom" and "stairs" and "ow" and laugh along because it's expected. He holds his beer in the cast hand like a trophy. People cheer. He bows.

"You should go to a doctor," Liv says, because she always says it.

"The doctor is expensive," he says. "The bar is cheap."

"The bar is not cheap," Kuba says without looking up. "The bar just feels cheap when you're drunk."

A wave of laughter moves through the room. The mood is light, the kind of light that ignores shadows. I ride it because it's easier than resisting.

Later, I head up to the dorm to grab my phone charger. In the hallway, the bathroom door is shut. The light underneath flickers like a slow pulse. I hear the shower running. Someone inside is singing to the sound of water, off-key, loud. It makes me smile until I notice the song is a lullaby, soft and wrong in that room. The singing stops mid-line. The water keeps running. I pause, listening. The door stays closed.

"You good in there?" I call.

"Yeah," a voice says. It's muffled. "Pipe scared the hell out of me." A laugh. "All good." The water shuts off. A minute later, a guy comes out with wet hair and a towel around his waist, eyes glassy. He gives me a thumbs up and shuffles away.

I go into the dorm and grab my charger. The bag where my shoes used to be is still on my bed. I kick it under the bunk like it's something I'm done with. My phone lights up with another message from my sister. I don't open it. I tell myself I'll answer later, after I sober up, after I figure out how to say I'm okay when I'm not sure.

Back downstairs, the party is starting early because this place doesn't know how to be quiet. People are dressed in red shorts and fake whistles. Someone has written LIFEGUARD ON DUTY across their chest in marker. The irony is thick enough to chew. They put a plastic kiddie pool in the courtyard and fill it halfway with beer. People cheer. People climb in. Someone almost slips getting out and the crowd howls like it's a bit. It is, until it isn't. I laugh anyway because it's part of the script.

Kuba hands me a whistle. "You are on duty," he says.

"I'm barely on my feet," I say.

"Exactly," he says. "Authentic."

We play along. I blow the whistle when people splash. The sound is sharp in my head. The courtyard smells like wet stone and cheap beer. The air is cold but the crowd is warm. The day loses its edges.

At some point, the German with the cast falls into the kiddie pool and everyone cheers. He comes up spluttering and laughs because it's easier than admitting it hurt. Someone slaps his back. He grimaces and raises his beer like a trophy. The lifeguards chant his name. I blow the whistle. My head buzzes.

The afternoon slides into evening like a drink going down. I should eat. I should rest. I should call Mum. Instead I drink because drinking is the only language this place speaks fluently. The noise in my head gets quieter for a while, then louder. My vision blurs at the edges. I rub my eyes and the blur hangs on for a second, then releases. I pretend it's the smoke from the courtyard heater.

Liv leans in. "You're not looking great."

"I'm a lifeguard," I say. "We're pale."

"You're grey," she says. She touches my wrist, two fingers, a quick check. "You should sit."

"After this drink," I say. The words are automatic. The cup is already in my hand.

Later, in the kitchen, I stand over a plate of goulash, trying to eat the salt and grease like it will glue me back together. The stew tastes like paprika and survival. My hands shake a little when I lift the spoon. I force it down. The warmth in my stomach is a small kindness. It doesn't last.

Petr walks in, security jacket half zipped. He leans against the counter and watches the room. His eyes catch mine. He nods toward the stairwell.

"You hear about the guy from Barcelona?" he asks.

"Which guy?"

"The one who slept in the shower because he was too drunk to walk. He woke up with blue feet," Petr says. He doesn't sound amused. "He went to hospital. Hypothermia. He said he didn't feel cold. That's the thing. You do not feel it until you do." He rubs his arms as if remembering.

"This place is a hazard," I say.

"This place is a mirror," he says. "You see what you bring." He shrugs and leaves.

A mirror. I don't like that idea. I look down at my hands, the tiny tremor, the dampness that never seems to leave them. I think about the way I keep saying tomorrow. I think about Mum's voice. I think about the pipe's dull tooth and the way the floor slides under a wet foot.

I finish the goulash and go outside for air. The courtyard is damp, fairy lights glowing like wet stars. The kiddie pool is half drained now, beer sloshing in the bottom. Someone has fallen asleep in a chair with a whistle around their neck. Their chest rises and falls slow and deep. They look like a lifeguard guarding no one.

I should stay there, in the cold, but the energy inside is already curling around me again, loud and insistent. I need something that's not the bar. I need to remember that I'm in a city, not just this building. When someone suggests a quick walk to Old Town for trdelnik, I say yes before I can think about it.

We spill into the street, five of us, jackets half zipped, breath white. Prague is damp and clean in the way only a morning-after city can be. The cobblestones shine. The river air cuts through my hoodie and makes me feel briefly awake. The city smells like sugar and smoke, like someone boiled beer in a bakery.

The group is a mix of people I barely know and one guy named Nico who always has a cigarette. He talks about a girl in Berlin who was \"spiritual\" and about a hostel in Budapest that had a slide from the bar to the dorms. Everyone laughs. I laugh because the story is ridiculous and because the idea of a slide in this building makes my knees hurt.

We cross a street and a tram bell rings sharp and bright. My foot catches on a slick stone and skids. It's nothing. It's just a tiny slip, the kind that happens a hundred times a day. But the shock runs up my legs and lands in my chest. I grab Nico's shoulder without thinking. He looks at me, eyebrow up.

"Floor is a trap," I say.

"Welcome to Prague," he says, and lights his cigarette. The smoke tastes like old ash when it drifts back toward me.

We stop by a bridge and look down at the river. It's a slate strip under the cloudy sky, a slow, cold thing. A tour boat moves through it like a silent white animal. The city around us is all spires and stone and a hundred years of people going about their lives. Somewhere across the water a church bell chimes. It sounds real in a way the hostel never does.

For a second, I feel the quiet under the noise, the person I might have been if I didn't need the noise so badly. The feeling is soft and dangerous. I swallow it down.

We buy trdelnik from a cart. The sugar sticks to my fingers. The warm bread tastes like cinnamon and relief. The vendor smiles and hands me a napkin. His hands are clean. I envy them.

On the walk back, my head starts to throb, a dull pressure behind my eyes. The chatter around me is muffled, like someone turned the volume down. I blink and the world lags. It's only for a second, but it makes my stomach turn.

"You okay?" a girl named Mae asks. She's Irish, red hair, loud laugh, a kindness I keep forgetting exists.

"Yeah," I say. "Just need water."

"There's a pharmacy," she says, pointing at a green cross glowing down the street. "You want electrolytes or something? Those little packet things?"

"I'm not that desperate," I say, then pause. "Actually, yeah, maybe."

Inside, the pharmacy is bright and clean, white tiles, the opposite of our bathroom. The air smells like antiseptic and mint. A woman behind the counter smiles with the patience of someone who has seen every kind of tourist. Mae buys rehydration salts. I buy painkillers and a tiny bottle of eye drops because my eyes feel like sandpaper. The packets are small and expensive. I pay anyway.

On the wall behind the counter is a poster of a little blue shower mat with a smiling face. It says, in Czech and English, SLIP-FREE SAFETY FOR YOUR HOME. The little mat looks cheerful. It feels like a taunt.

I stare at it too long. The woman behind the counter clears her throat. I buy the eye drops and leave.

Outside, the air feels colder. I shake two pills into my palm and dry swallow them with a mouthful of water. The pills scrape my throat. I can feel them sit in my stomach like pebbles. Mae hands me a packet of salts. I tear it open and pour the powder into my water bottle. It tastes like seawater and oranges. I drink it anyway.

"Look at us," Nico says. "Responsible."

"Don't get used to it," I say, and the group laughs because it's true.

On the way back, we pass a hostel tour group outside a different building. A guide points at a sign and says something in German. The sign says CAUTION WET FLOOR with a cartoon banana peel. I imagine that sign in our hallway, leaning uselessly against the wall, the peel grinning at the pipe. The irony is thick enough to chew.

Back at Mad House, the bar is louder, the lights warmer. The courtyard is already filling again. It feels like we've been gone for a week. The city disappears as soon as we cross the threshold, like it was a dream.

My phone buzzes again. It's Mum. I stare at the screen until it goes dark. The guilt is a constant ache, like the bruise on my shoulder. I press call before I can change my mind.

It rings once. Twice. My throat tightens.

"Brad?" Her voice is soft and too loud all at once.

"Hey, Mum," I say, and my voice cracks like a teenage boy's.

"Oh, thank God." I hear the relief in her breath. It makes my chest hurt. "Are you okay? Are you eating?"

"Yeah. All good. Just busy," I say. The lie is automatic, practiced.

"You sound tired. Where are you? Is it safe?"

"Prague. It's fine. It's just..." I look up at the wet courtyard, the beer-stained chairs, the light flickering. "It's a lot."

There's a pause. "You can come home, you know. You don't have to prove anything."

I swallow. The idea of home is warm and heavy. The idea of leaving feels like dropping the only mask I know how to wear. "Soon," I say. "Just a bit longer."

"You always say that," she says gently, and I realize Liv says the same thing. I close my eyes.

"I know," I say. "I just... I'm okay, Mum. I promise."

She sighs. "Okay. Just... call me more than once a month."

"I will." Another promise. Another bottle on the shelf.

"I love you," she says.

"Love you too," I say, and for a second it feels true in a way that hurts.

When I hang up, my hands are shaking. I tuck my phone into my pocket and breathe in the cold air until it hurts. The courtyard is emptying. The evening is settling. Somewhere inside, the music starts again, louder, a new wave.

I go back in and let the noise carry me. The lifeguard costumes have devolved into just shorts. People dance with whistles between their teeth. The bar glows. Kuba pours shots and shakes his head like he's already tired of tomorrow.

I drink less for a while. I sip water between beers. I feel almost responsible. Then someone starts a chant and I get swept into it. The chant turns into a drinking game. The drinking game turns into a blur. The blur turns into me in the stairwell, hand on the rail, climbing like it's a mountain.

On the third floor, the bathroom door is open. The light flickers, as always. The line of water is brighter now, a silver thread. A guy is sitting on the floor by the sinks, head in his hands. His hair drips. The water from his shower runs in a line toward the hall.

"You alright?" I ask.

He looks up, eyes red. "Just sat down for a second," he says. "The floor went out from under me." He laughs, then winces. "It's a trap."

"Yeah," I say. "It is."

He stands, wobbles, and grips the sink. I help him to his feet. He leans on me. We laugh because that's what you do when you don't want to be scared.

"You should use the ground floor," I say.

"Is it open?" he asks.

"No," I say.

He nods like that explains everything. He shuffles off toward his dorm, leaving a wet trail. I watch it for a second. It shines in the light like a warning sign.

In my dorm, the air is hot and thick. I peel off my clothes and sit on the edge of my bed, towel in hand, thinking about a shower. Thinking about the safe option that is locked. Thinking about the pipe. Thinking about the way my vision lags, the way the floor shifts. Thinking about the word tomorrow and how it feels like a debt.

The new sandals from Kuba are on the floor by my bed. One strap is loose. I pick them up and turn them over in my hands. The rubber is thin but it has treads. It is a compromise. It is also the only thing between my skin and the floor.

I set them by my towel so I won't forget in the morning. I tell myself I'll take a proper shower then, when the ground floor might be open. I tell myself I'll use the sandals if I have to use the third floor. I tell myself I'll be careful.

I climb into bed. The room spins gently. The sound of water starts up somewhere down the hall, the steady hiss of a shower turning on. I listen to it the way you listen to rain when you're camping, a sound that means shelter. The shower goes on too long. It always does.

"Tomorrow," I whisper into the dark. The word is a promise and a threat.

The water keeps running.
