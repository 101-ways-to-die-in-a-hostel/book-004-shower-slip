# Chapter 20: The Last Warning

The siren sounds like the shower.

It's the same long, wet wail, only this one slides through the building from the street and makes every window tremble. I bolt upright in my bunk, heart hammering, tongue glued to the roof of my mouth. The dorm is a cave of bodies and blankets. Someone mutters in their sleep. Someone coughs. The siren cuts through it all like a blade.

"What the hell?" I whisper, and the room answers with snores.

Another siren joins it. Then a third, distant and thin. It isn't even dawn. The street outside is dark, the air cold enough that it turns the glass into fog. The sirens are coming closer.

I swing my legs down. The broken sandal strap flops against my foot like a dead fish. The floor is cold, damp in that spot by the door. I step out into the hallway and the sirens are right there now, red light blinking through the stairwell window. I follow the sound because curiosity is my only sobriety.

Downstairs, the bar is half-lit. The couches are still full of sleeping bodies. Kuba stands by the front door, a hoodie thrown over his bar shirt. Petr is with him, arms crossed. Their faces are blank the way people look when something is happening that they don't want to be happening.

"What happened?" I ask.

Kuba glances at me, then back to the door. "Somebody slipped in the bathroom. Third floor. Not you. Another guy." He rubs his face. "Ambulance is for him. It’s not..." He doesn't finish the sentence.

The door opens. Cold air pours in. Two paramedics in bright jackets step inside, followed by a woman in a reflective vest who looks like she'd rather be anywhere else. The man on the stretcher is wrapped in a silver blanket. I can see his bare knee, his toes. His face is turned away. A bandage blooms pink at his temple.

Someone in the corner whispers, "Is he dead?"

"Nah," Kuba says, too fast. "He's breathing. He's talking. He's fine."

The word fine sounds brittle in his mouth. The stretcher wheels squeak over the tiles, leaving a thin wet line behind. The paramedics move with the kind of calm that comes from seeing too much. The guy on the stretcher groans and lifts a hand like he's waving at a crowd.

"All right, mate," someone says. It's Mae. She's leaning in the archway in a robe, hair in a knot. She looks pale in the low light. "What happened?"

"Pipe got me," the guy says, voice thick. He tries to laugh. It comes out wet. "Bloody pipe."

His words hit me low in the stomach. I can see the pipe in my head, the copper tooth, the way it gleams when the light flickers. I can see the smear on the wall, the handprint, the shadow of blood. I can see him slipping, the body turning, the head and the pipe meeting like fate.

Petr opens the door wide. The cold rushes in again, the air smelling like wet asphalt and smoke. The siren is louder now. The ambulance is right outside, waiting like a mouth. They wheel him out. The doors close. The light fades. The siren rises and pulls away, taking the sound with it.

The hostel exhales, and everyone pretends that nothing happened.

"Third floor is closed for a bit," Kuba says, loud enough for the lingering sleepy bodies to hear. "Use the second floor bathroom for now."

Someone groans in protest. Someone else cheers like it's a party move. A girl in a unicorn onesie laughs and says, "This place is wild." A few people wander back to their beds. The couches shift as people settle back into sleep. The night tries to pretend it didn't just blink.

I stand by the bar, my hands cold at my sides. The floor here is sticky with dried beer. It feels safer than the bathroom and that's a strange thing to think. Kuba catches my eye.

"He'll be fine," he says, softer. "Just a cut."

"Yeah," I say. "Just a cut."

The words don't sit right. I saw the bandage. I saw the way the guy's hand shook. A cut is not the point. The point is the pipe. The floor. The way the hostel can swallow someone and then spit them back out, bloodied and joking.

I go upstairs anyway. Curiosity is a stupid muscle, but I keep flexing it. The third-floor hallway is dim, the green emergency light making everything look sick. The caution tape isn't up yet. The bathroom door is open, steam pouring out like a confession.

Marta is inside with her mop. She has a bucket at her feet and the water inside it is the wrong color, a pale pink swirl. The smell is sharp: bleach and blood, a metallic tang cutting through the mildew. She's scrubbing the wall by the second stall, the smear dark and fresh. It streaks under her mop like a stubborn memory.

"You shouldn't be in here," she says without looking up. Her voice is flat, tired, like she's said it a thousand times.

"Just wanted to see," I say, and my voice sounds small in the tile echo.

She sighs and keeps scrubbing. "Nothing to see. Only mess." She points with the mop handle at the drain, where hair and soap and a thin thread of red collect like a slow tide. "Always mess."

I step closer, careful. The floor is slick, the concrete dark with water. My sandals squeak. In the second stall, the pipe is wet. A thin line of blood runs down its length, mixing with the spray that still drips from the showerhead. It looks like the pipe has a nosebleed.

"He hit that?" I ask.

Marta shrugs. "He hit everything." She drops the mop and uses a gloved hand to peel the damp paper sign off the wall that says SHOWER SOBER. DON'T BE A HEADLINE. It tears in the middle. The skull's grin rips in half. "He is lucky."

Lucky is a word I don't know what to do with. Lucky means the pipe missed his brain by a centimetre. Lucky means he could still joke on the stretcher. Lucky means there isn't a body on the tiles right now. It feels like a coin you can only flip once.

"You guys should fix this," I say, because it feels like someone should say it.

Marta gives me a look that could clean rust. "We say. Filip says no. He says, 'Not in budget.'" She wags the mop at the floor. "You say to guests, you be careful. They laugh. They slip. We mop." She shrugs like that's the whole story.

In the sink, someone has left a trail of diluted blood. It swirls around the drain in a lazy spiral. It looks almost pretty. That thought makes my stomach roll.

"Do you ever..." I start, and stop. I don't know what I'm asking.

"Do I care?" she says, answering a different question. "I care. I am tired of caring." She looks at me then, really looks, her eyes heavy. "You don't care enough. That is the problem." She turns back to the wall and scrubs harder.

The shower drips. The pipe gleams. The floor whispers under my feet. I want to step closer, to touch the pipe, to make it less of a monster. I don't. I back out instead, careful not to slip, and the hallway air feels colder than before.

I go upstairs because there's nowhere else to go. On the third floor, the bathroom door is propped open. A line of yellow caution tape is tied across the entrance, sagging in the middle like a lazy smile. Someone has taped a piece of paper to it with black marker: BATHROOM CLOSED. USE FLOOR 2. THANKS.

The paper is already wrinkled and damp at the corners. The tape is already failing.

I stare at the tape. I stare at the door. I can see the inside in my mind: the flickering light, the puddles, the smear, the pipe. I can smell the mildew without stepping in. I taste something metallic on my tongue.

"Don't even think about it," a voice says.

It's Liv, in an oversized hoodie, hair sticking up like a scarecrow. She holds a mug of coffee like it's the last warmth in her life. Her eyes are heavy, but she sees me.

"Not thinking," I say.

"You are. Your face is thinking." She sips her coffee. "This is the most obvious warning the universe has ever given anyone, Brad. Like, neon and everything. Don't do anything stupid."

"I don't do stupid," I say, and then remember the tarp, the pipe, the beer, the way my sandals are held together by a knot. "Okay. I do stupid. But not now."

She studies me like she's trying to decide if I'm a joke or a tragedy. "Just use the other bathroom. And for the love of god, take a shower sober." She says it like it's a foreign concept.

"Yeah," I say. "Sure. Sober showers. Great."

We both laugh, because laughing is how you keep dread from sitting too long.

I go back to bed. The sirens are gone. The building settles. I close my eyes and the copper pipe flashes in the dark like a warning sign.

---

By noon the hostel has decided the ambulance was just a blip in the party soundtrack. The bar is alive again. The lights are warm. The smell of toast and beer mixes into something that could almost be breakfast if you weren't being honest with yourself.

Filip stands on a chair near the bar, holding a stack of papers. He's in a clean shirt, the kind he wears when someone has left a bad review. He taps a spoon against a glass and waits for the noise to die down. It doesn't, not really. He starts talking anyway.

"Attention, legends," he says, the word rolling out like he's smiling. "Quick safety thing. I know, boring. Bear with me." He lifts a paper. "This is a new waiver. Just says we told you the bathrooms are slippery and you should be careful. If you can sign it at reception today, that would be brilliant. Free shot for anyone who signs."

A cheer goes up. The word waiver gets swallowed by the word free. People line up at the counter like it's the start of a drinking game.

Kuba slides the papers across the bar. The waiver is a thin sheet with a block of text in English and Czech. I skim it. It says the hostel isn't responsible if you get hurt in the bathroom. It says use at your own risk. It says the walls and floors are not the hostel's fault. There's a little box at the bottom that says GUEST ACKNOWLEDGES ALL RISKS. I sign my name because my hand knows how to do that now. I take the shot because it's in front of me.

The liquor burns down my throat and for a second it feels like this is all a game with rules, like if you sign and drink, you're protected. Then I remember the guy on the stretcher, the way his bandage bloomed pink, and the protection feels like paper.

Mae sidles up beside me, eyes on the waiver. "Did you see him this morning?" she asks.

"Yeah," I say.

"He was still talking when they took him out. I heard him say he was fine." She gives a small, humorless laugh. "Everyone says that."

"It's the only word we know," I say.

She looks at me, and I can see the worry trying to break through her smile. "Don't be a headline," she says, nodding toward the sign someone has taped above the bar: SHOWER SOBER. DON'T BE A HEADLINE. The skull in the shower cap has been drawn again, the smile wider now.

"The headline would be boring," I say. "Local idiot does local idiot thing."

"Still a headline," she says.

I want to tell her I'm going home soon. I want to tell her about Mum, about the texts, about the way my chest hurts every time I feel my heart skip because I'm hungover. Instead I take another sip of beer and say, "I'm not going to die in the shower, if that's what you mean." The words are too loud, too certain.

She nods like she's heard that before too. "Just... be careful."

Careful. The word has been following me for days. It feels like a leash I don't know how to wear.

Later, I drift up to the second floor bathroom because I do actually need a shower and the third floor is still taped off, though the tape is now a joke of itself, drooping like a sad banner. The second floor bathroom is smaller but just as damp. The tiles are intact, but the floor is slick with soap. Someone has hung a sign above the sinks: NO RUNNING. NO DIVING. NO DYING. The last one is underlined with a wink.

I stand by the sinks and watch a German guy in the far stall. He steps out and his foot slides sideways. He catches himself on the edge of the sink and lets out a sharp laugh.

"Scheiße," he says.

"You all right?" I ask.

"Ja," he says. He looks at the sign and shakes his head. "Funny place."

I nod. The floor is still wet. The water still pools. The light is steady here, not flickering, which makes the room feel less haunted but not safer. The danger is in the floor, not the light.

I back away. I don't shower. I tell myself I'll do it later, when the third floor opens again, when it's less crowded, when I'm less hungover. Later has become my religion.

I head back down. The bar is louder now, music pulsing. People are already on their second or third recovery beer. The day is slipping into the kind of afternoon that smells like sweat and hope.

"You shower?" Liv asks, sliding into a chair beside me with two beers in her hands.

"Not yet," I say.

"You can't keep dodging it," she says.

"Watch me." I take a beer. The glass is cold. The foam smells like bread and regret. "I'll do it tonight. Sober-ish."

"Sober-ish is a myth," she says, and clinks her bottle against mine.

We drink. The day moves. The warning fades into the background, replaced by the immediate pull of noise, laughter, the room's warm ache. The hostel knows how to swallow worry. It chews it up with music and beer and passes it off as a joke.

---

By evening the tape on the third floor bathroom has been removed. There is no announcement. The paper sign is gone. The door is open like it always is. The line of water snakes across the hallway like a path you're supposed to follow.

I stand outside the bathroom with my towel over my shoulder and my mat tucked under my arm. The mat is a different one now, thinner, with a smiley face on it. It smells like rubber and fresh lies. I stole it from the box by reception when no one was looking. It feels like confession and survival in my hands.

The light inside flickers. The pipe gleams. The smear on the wall is darker than before, fresh where someone tried to wipe it and just made it spread. The floor glistens like a black mirror. The drain gurgles. The room is empty.

"Do it," I tell myself. "Do it quick."

I step in. The air is warm and damp. The smell of mildew hits like a punch. I unroll the mat and press it into the concrete with my bare feet. The suction cups catch for a half-second, then release. The mat slides toward the drain. I press it again, harder, palms flat, fingers splayed. The mat lifts and slips, stubborn as a bad decision.

"Come on," I whisper. The concrete is cold under my hands, gritty. Water from the floor runs between my fingers. The mat is no match for the floor. I can feel it in the way it gives up.

The door opens behind me. I turn. It's the guy from earlier, the one with the towel around his shoulders, the one who said the floor eats mats. He's back, the local drifter. He nods at the mat and gives me a look that says you already know.

"Still trying," he says.

"I'm stubborn," I say.

"Stubborn gets you killed here," he says, and it's not a joke.

I laugh anyway because the alternative is to admit he's right. "You should do stand-up," I say.

He doesn't smile. He steps into the stall beside me and turns on the water. The cold hiss fills the room, spraying the concrete, making the floor slicker. The mat shifts again. The suction cups skitter like teeth.

"You're making it worse," I say, half joking.

"It's already worse," he says. "This place is worse." He closes his curtain. The water beats against the wall, against the pipe. The sound is loud and insistent, a reminder that the building doesn't care.

I lift the mat. It's wet and useless. I carry it to the far-left stall again, the one with a few stubborn tiles. I press it down. The suction cups catch on the tile for a moment, and my chest loosens. Then the corner peels up and the whole thing slides sideways. It settles crooked, half-attached, like a smile that doesn't reach the eyes.

"Good enough," I say, because I need a win.

I strip down and step in. The concrete is slick even with the mat, the edges exposed. I keep one hand on the wall. The water is cold at first, then lukewarm. It hits my shoulders and my skin pricks. The spray is uneven, spitting like a bad attitude. I close my eyes for a second and the room tilts. I open them fast. I focus on the pipe in the corner, the copper line that sits too close to where my head would be if I slipped.

"Just be careful," I tell myself.

The mat shifts under my feet. Not much. Just a little. Enough to make my heart spike. I open my eyes wider and grip the wall harder, fingers slipping on soap. The wall isn't as steady as it looks. The mat is moving. The floor is moving. The world is moving.

"Nope," I mutter. I turn the water off fast. The silence is a slap. I step out, grab my towel, and dry off without really drying. The shower is over in less than a minute. My hair is still dirty. My skin still smells like beer. But I'm upright.

I pull my shorts on, stuff the mat under my arm, and leave the bathroom without looking back. My heart is too loud in my chest. The hallway feels colder than before. The line of water is still there, daring me to step on it. I step around it like it's a snake.

Downstairs, the party is already building. The music is louder, the lights warmer. People are drinking like it's a cure. I slide onto a bar stool and let the noise wash over me. Kuba pours a beer and sets it in front of me without asking. He watches me for a second.

"You look like you saw a ghost," he says.

"Just the shower," I say.

He laughs, but his eyes don't. "You know, Filip's going to get rid of the pipe," he says, like it's news.

"When?"

"When a lawyer tells him to. Or when someone dies." He says it like it's a joke, then shrugs. "Drink."

I drink because it's easier than thinking about a lawyer or a body. The beer tastes like warm metal. I swallow it anyway.

The night swells. People dance. The bar sweats. The walls throb with bass. I get pulled into a drinking game. I lose on purpose to keep the shots coming. I tell myself I deserve the fun because I did something responsible by trying to shower. The logic is crooked, but that's how I live.

At some point, a girl collapses on the couch and starts crying softly. Her friend rubs her back and says, "It's fine. It's fine." I recognize the phrase. It's everyone's favorite lie. I sip my drink and let the music drown her out.

Around two, I stumble out into the courtyard. The tarp is still there, wet and wrinkled. The fairy lights make the puddles look like stars. I sit on a damp chair and watch the water reflect the light. My hands shake a little. The cold air makes me feel almost sober for a second. In the quiet between songs, I hear the shower running upstairs. The sound is faint but steady, like a heartbeat.

"Brad," someone says.

I look up. Mae stands in the doorway, her face half-lit by the bar lights. "You coming to bed?"

"Soon," I say. "Just... air." My voice is slower now. The beer is in my blood.

She steps closer, wraps her arms around herself. "You're scaring me a bit," she says. It's almost a whisper.

"Me?" I laugh. "I'm the safest man in this place."

She doesn't laugh. "Promise me something."

"You're going to make me do something sober, aren't you?"

"Promise me you'll not shower if you're smashed." She says it like a rule, like a prayer.

I want to say yes. I want to say anything that will make her eyes soften. Instead I say, "I'll be fine."

She studies me, then nods once, like she's done all she can. "You're a good bloke, Brad. Don't be stupid." She goes back inside.

The cold air feels sharper after she leaves. I look up at the third-floor windows. One of them flickers with the bathroom light. I imagine the pipe, the floor, the mat, the water. I imagine my head against copper. I shake it off. I'm not that guy. I'm not going to be that story. I have more nights in me. I have more mornings. I have home waiting, even if I pretend I don't.

I go back inside. The bar is a storm. Liv grabs my arm and pulls me into the crowd. We dance because dancing keeps the doubt away. The music is loud enough to cover the sound of anything else. I drink because the rhythm is faster than my thoughts. I laugh because the night demands it.

Somewhere around four, the party starts to thin. People collapse in corners. The music slows. The walls stop sweating. I climb the stairs with the mat under my arm and the broken sandal on my foot, and I feel like I'm carrying a small, ridiculous lifeline.

In the hallway, the line of water is thinner now but still there, a pale ribbon in the emergency light. I step over it and my foot skates. My heart leaps. I grab the wall and steady myself. I laugh into the empty hall because the sound of fear is worse than the sound of laughter.

I reach my bunk and drop the mat by my towel like it's a talisman. I kick off the sandals. The strap on the broken one finally gives up and snaps in half. I stare at it, then at my feet. They're pale, clean in a way that feels wrong. I should shower again in the morning. I should do it properly, sober-ish. The thought lands like a plan.

I crawl into bed. The room leans left, slow and kind. My phone buzzes with another message. I don't look. I can't. I turn my face to the wall.

The shower turns on down the hall. The hiss fills the room like a warning.

"Tomorrow," I whisper. "Shower first. Then water. Then maybe a nap."

I say it like it's a promise. The building doesn't answer.
