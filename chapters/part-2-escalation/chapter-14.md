# Chapter 14: The Rusted Halo

The water spits brown for a second, like it's coughing something up it doesn't want to remember.

I flinch anyway, hand on the tap, eyes on the pipe. The stream clears, goes to cold, then too hot, then settles into a warm, indifferent flow. It hits my chest and I breathe out like I've been holding my breath all day. The smell of damp concrete and cheap soap rises with the steam. The flickering light makes the water stutter on my skin, stop-start like a broken video.

Behind me, the hallway is a slit of green light. The door stays open because I can't handle the click of it closing. The shower stall feels like a stage. The pipe is the only audience.

I keep one hand on the wall. It isn't a grab bar, but my fingers can find the grout lines, the little ridges where the tiles still exist. The tiles are cold, the concrete floor is cold, the water is warm. My head is still doing that slow boat-rock, but the warmth makes it quieter.

"Just a shower," I say again, like it's a spell.

I reach for the soap, and my hand brushes the pipe. The metal is colder than it should be, colder than the wall. It is a thin, rusted stub of a thing, a hacked-off arm where a showerhead once lived. There's a ring of green around the base, like it wears a rotten halo.

I pull my hand back. The skin on my knuckles looks pale. I rub soap between my palms, make a thin foam that smells like lemon and lies. I scrub my shoulders. The Southern Cross tattoo blurs under the water. It looks like it's drowning.

The floor shifts under my feet, or maybe it's me. I widen my stance. I look down, and there it is again: the dark streak on the wall, higher than it should be, a smudge that didn't come from a hand. In the flicker it goes from brown to black and back. It could be old rust. It could be old blood. I stare at it until my stomach dips.

"Wild night for someone," I say, to the wall, to myself, to the pipe.

The water runs down my face and I close my eyes, just for a second, and in that second I see Mum's beach photo again, bright and blue and impossible. Then I see the beach as a flat grey line, a horizon that tips like this room, and I open my eyes too fast and the world snaps back.

"Careful, yeah?"

The voice is low and accented, male. I startle so hard my heel slides a fraction. I grab the wall and catch myself. Soap slicks my fingers. I twist around, water dripping, and a man stands in the doorway, towel around his waist, chest hair damp. He's not one of the regulars. He's older, mid-thirties maybe, with a shaved head and tired eyes.

"You're all right," he says. It's not a question.

"Yeah," I say. "All good. Just soap." I try to laugh. It comes out thin.

He nods toward the pipe. "That thing, it is not safe. I told Kuba. He laughs." He steps inside, keeping his feet close together like he knows the land.

"It looks worse than it is," I say, because I have to. "You just don't smack it with your head, hey. Simple." I try to make it a joke.

He doesn't smile. "My friend. He fell last month. Not here. In the other shower. He hit here." He taps his temple. "Blood everywhere. He thought he was fine. He went to sleep. He woke up in hospital." He points to the streak on the wall. "That is from him. They clean, but it stays. The wall remembers." He says it like a proverb, like he's seen walls remember before.

"Bloody hell," I say, even though I'm thinking about that streak, about the water turning pink in it. I imagine someone standing where I am. I imagine the pipe finding a head. My head.

He keeps talking, as if this is normal morning chat. "You should wear shoes. You should not shower when you are"—he searches for the word and then gives up—"like this." He gestures at my face. The gesture says hungover, says drunk, says stupid.

"I'm not that bad," I say, because it's reflex. The words taste like alcohol.

He lifts his eyebrows. "You are in the shower, talking to a stranger, with no pants, in a hostel that smells like beer. You are a little bad." There is a smile now, a small one.

I laugh. It feels better than the truth. "Fair," I say.

He steps out and tugs the door wider. "Anyway. I go. Be careful, Brad." He knows my name. Everyone does. It should feel good. It doesn't.

"Cheers, mate," I say.

He leaves. The door swings, bumps the frame, hangs open. The green light in the hallway floods the stall for a second and the pipe looks like it's glowing. I turn my head away. The water keeps running. I scrub the soap off with quick movements.

"Not today," I tell the pipe. I say it like it's a deal.

When I step back, my foot hits the slick patch by the drain. It slides just enough to make my stomach drop. My arms go out and I catch the wall, fingers scraping along the grout. The soap makes my grip weaker. The stall tilts, the pipe rushes at the edge of my vision, and for half a second I see the rest of my life like it's a flash photo.

I stop. I breathe. I plant my feet. The water keeps running over my toes, pooling around my heels. I turn it off with my left hand without moving my feet. The silence after is like someone died.

I dry off in the stall, towel around my waist, keeping my eyes on the floor. The streak on the wall looks darker now that the water's off. I pretend it's rust. I tell myself I'm making it dramatic because I'm hungover. I tell myself the Czech guy is paranoid. Everyone in this hostel is dramatic about something. It's part of the package.

At the sink, the mirror is fogged and my face swims in it. I wipe a clear circle with my hand and stare at myself. The bruise on my shoulder is darker. My eyes are bloodshot, the whites yellowed at the edges. The skin under my eyes looks a little grey. I smile. The mirror doesn't smile back, not really. The smile looks like a crack in a wall.

The hallway feels colder than the bathroom. Marta is there with her mop, moving the same line of water like she's trying to herd it. She looks at me, at the towel around my waist, at the way I'm leaning too hard on the wall.

"You should sleep," she says, because that's what she says to everyone.

"Soon," I say.

She eyes my wet feet. "Get shoes. You will fall." She says it like she's reading a menu.

"Maybe tomorrow," I say, because tomorrow is always when I do the sensible thing.

She makes a noise that could be a sigh or a curse. She goes back to pushing the mop, and the line of water moves and moves and never leaves.

On the stairs down, I keep my hand on the rail, even though the rail is sticky and the paint flakes off under my fingers. The building smells like wet clothes and stale beer, and something fried from the kitchen. The bar is in that liminal morning mode where the lights are on but dim, like it can't decide whether it's day or night. A couple of bodies are still slumped on the couches, blankets pulled over their heads like they're in a ward.

Kuba spots me and slides a glass of water across the counter without a word. He does it for everyone, but it feels personal anyway. I down it and feel it hit my empty stomach like a stone.

"You survive the shower?" he asks, polishing a glass that doesn't need it.

"Barely," I say.

He grimaces. "We put in a request for mats last year," he says. "Manager says mats make it feel like hotel. I say head trauma makes it feel like morgue. We agree to disagree." He shrugs like it's a joke. It isn't.

I laugh because that's what you do. "Could hang a sign," I say.

"We did," he says. "Someone stole it. Hung it in their room." He points to the wall where a faded sticker reads STAY HYDRATED in six languages. The sticker is peeling at the edges like it's trying to escape.

A shout comes from the hallway. I hear a thud, then a laugh. Petr's voice follows, low and annoyed. "Up, mate. Up." I set my glass down and peek into the corridor.

A guy is sprawled on the steps, shirt inside out, eyes rolling. He's got a green wristband on, the VIP kind for the basement party. One shoe is missing. His knee is bleeding a thin red line that runs down his shin. The floor around him is wet, as if the building sweats where people fall.

"You good?" I ask.

"Yeah," he says, which is always a lie. He tries to stand and slides back down. Petr grabs one arm, I grab the other, and we lift him to his feet. He leans all his weight onto us like a limp flag.

"You showered?" he slurs.

"Not you," I say. "You're a slip hazard with legs."

He laughs, then hiccups. We guide him into the rage cage, the tiny room off the bar that's mostly mattresses and dark. It's supposed to be a safe place. It looks like a padded cell. We drop him on a mattress and he rolls onto his side without waking.

"He went to bathroom," Petr says, wiping his hands on his jeans. "Slipped. He said floor there is ice. I told him to use ground floor. He said third floor closer." Petr shakes his head. "Lazy kills."

"No one listens," I say.

"People come here to not listen," Petr says. He eyes me, like he wants to say more. Then he claps me on the shoulder and walks away.

I stare into the rage cage for a second. A girl is already in there, curled up on her side with a hoodie over her face. Her bare foot sticks out from under the blanket, toes blue with cold. She twitches as if she's dreaming of falling.

I go back to the bar and sit on a stool. The room spins a little. I put my palm flat on the counter to steady myself. The wood is sticky. It smells like citrus cleaner and old beer. The music is low, some acoustic song about running away. It feels too sincere for this room.

A guy with a camera around his neck sits next to me. He's new, pale, a little excited. He asks about the best clubs. I tell him to ask the bar staff. He asks about the shower. I tell him to buy flip-flops. He laughs like I'm exaggerating. I don't correct him.

"Is it really that bad?" he asks.

"It isn't great," I say.

He looks at my wet hair. "You look clean. So it can't be that bad."

"It can be both," I say. He doesn't get it.

My phone buzzes again, a string of messages from the group chat. The boys are sending a video of someone doing a shoey out of a work boot. I watch it without sound. I imagine the taste. My stomach flips. I put the phone away.

A woman at the end of the bar is rinsing out a wound in the sink behind the counter. It's Marta. Her knuckles are red and raw, the skin split. She mutters in Czech as she wraps them. Kuba watches with the same tired look he has for everything.

"What happened?" I ask.

"Shower door fell," Kuba says, like he's telling me the price of a beer. "She told Filip we need new hinges. He told her to use tape." He says it flat, like he's resigned to the absurdity.

Marta lifts her bandaged hand and shakes her head at me. "Not safe," she says. Then she goes back to the kitchen without another word.

"This place is a death trap," I say, and the words come out light, like a joke. The way I say them makes it safe. It's easier than meaning it.

"Maybe," Kuba says. "But people keep coming."

I take another glass of water. I take it slow. I try to imagine leaving. The thought is like trying to picture another planet. Prague without this hostel. Brad without this bar. Brad without the drink. My chest tightens. I take a breath and let the tightness dissolve.

When I go back upstairs, I climb slowly. The stairwell is narrow, the walls covered in graffiti and stickers. One reads TAKE THE STAIRS, IT'S HEALTHY in block letters. Another says DON'T DIE HERE with a smiley face. I pause in front of it and laugh, a small sound that feels like a cough.

On the third floor, a couple of guys are arguing in German near the bathrooms. One of them points at the floor, his voice raised. The other shrugs. Someone's phone rings. The light flickers. The line of water shines.

"You go first," one says.

"No way," the other says, and they both laugh because the joke is that it's not a joke.

I slide past them and head for the dorm.

I go back to the dorm and dress slow, like I'm learning how to do it again. My phone buzzes with the morning round of messages: Mum, my sister, a group chat from home where the boys are sending photos of a backyard BBQ. I look at the pictures of steak and clean grass and someone else's dog. The dog has a little bandage on its paw. I zoom in on it like it's important.

I don't answer anyone. I scroll through Instagram instead. My story from last night has a few new views. I tap through a couple of other people's stories: a Brit chugging a beer, a German girl crying in a bathroom, a photo of the bar with caption BEST PLACE EVER. I add a new one, a selfie with wet hair, the flickering bathroom light behind me. I write CLEAN AGAIN in all caps. I almost add a skull emoji, then delete it.

By midday, the bar is awake and the building is humming. The smell of toast and stale beer mixes with the wet concrete smell that never leaves. I sit at a table with Liv and a new guy named Nate from Canada who's been here exactly one night and already talks like he's been here forever.

"You look like death," Nate says, and grins because it's funny.

"Cheers," I say. I lift my water like it's a toast. The water tastes like the sink upstairs. I drink it anyway. It helps for a minute.

Liv looks at me over her coffee. "Did you eat?"

"Banana," I say.

"That's not a meal, Brad. That's a suggestion." She pushes a plate of scrambled eggs toward me. The eggs are greyish, rubbery. I eat them because they're there.

Kuba is behind the bar, wiping the same glass he's been wiping for ten minutes. He has a bandage on his finger. He sees me and points at my feet.

"You still no shower shoes?" he asks.

"I survived," I say.

"Surviving is not a plan," he says, and it's a joke that is also not a joke.

"It's my whole brand," I say. People laugh. The bar likes the version of me that makes the punchline. The real version of me hides in the bathroom and talks to pipes.

Nate leans in. "Is it true about the third-floor bathroom?" he asks, like he's asking about a haunted house.

"Depends what you mean by true," Liv says.

"I slipped in there last night," he says, eyes wide. "Wasn't even drunk. The floor just went out." He makes a sliding gesture with his hand. "I thought I was going to crack my head. There's that pipe, man. It's right there. It looks like a weapon." He laughs, but his eyes are serious.

"It is a weapon," I say, and I don't mean it as a joke. The table goes quiet for a second. I lift my water. "To bad decisions," I add, and everyone laughs because that's safe.

Kuba sets a bowl of peanuts on the bar like it's a peace offering. Someone turns the music up. The bar starts to fill with the midday crowd. The Dutch guy from yesterday walks in with fresh bandages on his knee. A couple of French girls come down with towels around their hair, laughing too loud. The building doesn't care who is laughing. It keeps breathing.

At two, the walking tour group leaves. The rest of us drift into our usual gravity: the bar stools, the couches, the courtyard. The rain has stopped. The sky is a low grey lid. The fairy lights are still on, because they never really turn off.

I take my beer outside. The air is cold and damp, a clean slap. A local guy leans against the courtyard wall, smoking. He's Czech, maybe in his late twenties, wearing a jacket with a tiny flag patch on the sleeve. I've seen him around but never talked.

"You are the Australian," he says, in English that is careful and precise.

"Guilty," I say.

He nods toward my beer. "You people drink like you are at war." He says it like an observation, not a criticism.

"It's training for retirement," I say.

He makes a small amused sound. He takes a drag from his cigarette. "Your bathroom," he says. "You showered in the third floor?"

"This morning," I say.

He shakes his head. "It is dangerous. My cousin worked here. He told me to never go there. They do not fix anything. They do not care. The pipe is from the communists," he says, and he actually smiles.

"Everything's from the communists in this place," I say.

He points with his cigarette toward the building. "Not the mold. That is new." He flicks ash. "You should use the ground floor bathroom. Or wait. Or not shower. People here do not care about smell." He glances at the courtyard where a guy is asleep with a beer can balanced on his chest. "Smell is normal. Death is not."

"Tell that to my mum," I say.

He chuckles. "You do not text her?" he asks, and I wonder how he knows anything about me. Then I remember this place is a fishbowl. Everyone knows everything.

"She'd kill me if I died in a shower," I say, and it comes out too real.

The local looks at me for a beat. "My uncle died in a shower," he says. "At home. Old. Slipped. He was alone for two days." He says it flat, like he's saying the weather.

"Jesus," I say.

He shrugs. "Bathrooms are small. They hurt people. Be careful." He takes a last drag and stubs the cigarette on the wall. "I am going to the old town. You should come. It is not only beer here. There is also history." He says history like it's a substitute for sobriety.

"Maybe tomorrow," I say, and there it is again, the word that protects me from changing anything.

He goes, disappearing through the gate. I sit with my beer. The line of water in the hallway flashes in my mind, the pipe with its green halo. My stomach twists. I drink. The beer smooths the twist.

By evening, the bar is loud again. The staff are running a themed night: Czech clichés, they call it, which means everyone wears socks with sandals and drinks a shot of something green. Kuba slaps a tiny flag sticker on my chest and says, "You are honorary Czech. It is your curse." I take the shot. It tastes like sugar and gasoline.

The music gets louder. The lights shift to red. The room becomes a heartbeat. People dance on the tables. Someone starts a chant about beer. I know the words. I shout them. I feel like myself again, which is to say I feel like a performance of myself.

A girl with a shaved head drags me into a circle and we dance until the floor moves without me. My head spins from the lights, from the alcohol, from the way everyone is moving as if moving is a requirement of being alive. I keep moving because it's the easiest thing.

Between songs, I check my phone. A message from my sister: Please call Mum. Please. The second please is all caps.

I type, Later, promise. I don't send it. I delete it. I post a story instead: a video of the bar, my own laugh in it, the caption STILL STANDING. The likes come fast. The real messages don't.

At some point, I find myself outside again, leaned against the courtyard wall with my head tilted back. The sky is black and the rain has started again. The droplets feel like needles on my face. I let them hit me because it feels like something. The fairy lights turn the rain into little beads of gold.

Petr, the security guy, walks past and slows. "You all right, Brad?" he asks.

"Never better," I say.

He looks at me for a long moment. His face is the face of someone who has carried too many bodies to bed. "Maybe go to sleep," he says. "You have been here long time. Your body is tired." He doesn't sound like he's lecturing. He sounds like he's naming something obvious.

"Sleep when I'm dead," I say, because it's what I always say.

He doesn't laugh. He just nods once, like he has heard that line too many times. "Maybe sleep before," he says. Then he walks away.

The words sit with me. Sleep before. It sounds like advice from a fortune teller, like a warning I can't translate. I take a breath. The rain smells like stone. My head is heavy. My mouth tastes like copper.

Liv finds me and loops her arm through mine. "Come on," she says. "Family dinner. We need to put something real in our bodies." She says real like it might fix the rest.

We go downstairs. The dining area is crowded. The goulash is a brown, thick soup that tastes like salt and pepper and the ghosts of real kitchens. I eat it fast. It sits in my stomach like a brick. It makes the alcohol feel less sharp. It also makes me sleepy.

I go up to the dorm early for once, leaving the party while it still has teeth. The hallway on the third floor is quiet, just the hum of music below and the drip of a faucet. The line of water is still there, reflecting the emergency light like a warning stripe.

The bathroom door is open. The flicker is slower now, like the bulb is tired. I pause in the doorway without meaning to. The smell of mildew hits me. The pipe is a dark shape in the corner. The streak on the wall is there, a brown finger dragged down. It looks fresh. It couldn't be, but it looks fresh.

I step inside. The floor is wet, of course. Someone is showering in the far stall. I hear the water hitting concrete, the hollow slap. The person hums a tune I don't recognize. The sound is thin and distant, like it's coming from another room, another life.

I lean toward the sink and splash water on my face. The water is cold enough to sting. I look up and the mirror is warped, the edges wobbly. In the reflection the pipe looks closer to me than it is. For a second I can't tell which is more real: the pipe or the idea of it.

"Don't be dramatic," I whisper, and the whisper echoes.

I step back and my heel catches on the wet floor. I slide a few inches before I can stop. It's nothing, not even a real slip, but my heart hammers. I laugh, too loud in the small room, and the person in the stall goes quiet for a second.

"All good," I call.

"Mm-hmm," they say, and the water keeps running.

I leave. In the hallway, my legs feel wobbly. My towel hangs heavy over my shoulder. The dorm door is at the end of the hall, a rectangle of darkness. I walk slow, one foot at a time.

Inside, the room is dim. The guy above me snores. The air smells of sweat and beer and damp clothes. I strip down and collapse on my bunk. The mattress is thin. The springs push back like they want me to get up.

My phone buzzes. It's Mum again. Are you safe? Are you eating? Please call.

I stare at the words until the screen goes dim. I don't answer. I set the phone face down. The blanket feels damp. The room spins, slow and steady, like a carousel.

I close my eyes and the image of the pipe floats up. The rusted halo. The wall remembers. The local's uncle in the shower. The Czech guy's friend with blood. The way the floor slid under me this morning. The way I laughed each time because laughing makes it smaller.

"Tomorrow," I say into the dark. "I'll use the ground floor shower. Tomorrow I'll be careful. Tomorrow I'll call Mum. Tomorrow I'll sleep before." I say it like a prayer.

Somewhere down the hall, a shower turns on. The water hits concrete. It sounds like rain in a metal bucket.

I lie there and listen. The sound doesn't stop.
