# Chapter 15: The Running Shower

The shower is running and no one is in it.

That is the first thing I know, before I even open my eyes. I can hear the wet slap of water on concrete through the dorm wall, the steady hiss like a person whispering the same word over and over. My mouth tastes like pennies. My tongue feels like old carpet. Someone is snoring above me, a slow chainsaw rhythm, and every time the snore dips the water sound swells to fill the gap.

For a second I think I'm dreaming. The water in the dream never stops. The pipes in this building have their own heartbeat. They tick and groan, they clear their throats, they spit. But this is different. This is on, not dripping. This is a shower left open like a mouth.

I sit up and the room rolls. A thin nausea threads through me, tight and bright. The bunk above is a dark rectangle. The window is grey with rain. Someone has left their shoes on the floor and the smell of wet rubber and beer is sharp as a slap. I swing my feet down and the cold floor grabs me.

"Who left the shower on?" I say, because saying it makes it normal.

No one answers. The dorm breathes. The water keeps running.

I grab my towel and stumble into the hallway. The line of water on the floor is there, of course, shining in the green emergency light like a thin wire. My foot skates half an inch on the damp and my stomach jumps. I catch myself on the wall, fingers finding the gritty paint. The building feels like it's leaning, or maybe it's me.

The bathroom door is open. The light inside flickers in tired pulses. The sound of running water fills the room, a steady, stubborn hiss. I step in and the smell hits me: mildew, old soap, the faint copper tang that makes the back of my throat go metallic. All three shower stalls are empty. One of them is on, water streaming onto the concrete, pooling around the clogged drain like a shallow pond.

The curtainless stall looks like a crime scene waiting for its body. The pipe at head height gleams with that green rust halo. The handprint on the wall is a faint ghost now, a brown smudge that won't leave no matter how much Marta mops. Someone has drawn a smiley face in the steam on the mirror. It is already fading.

"Cheers," I mutter, and step carefully into the stall. The floor is slick even where the water doesn't reach. My feet slide a fraction and I spread my stance, knees bent like I'm surfing. I reach for the tap and turn it off. The water coughs and stops. The silence that follows is bigger than the room.

I stand there for a second, listening. The drain gurgles, still trying to swallow the puddle. Somewhere downstairs, music starts up, a low bass thump like a heartbeat in a different body. The pipe stares at me, the wall remembers, the floor waits.

I back out, slow. The bathroom is empty and wet and charged, like a stage after the actors have left. I wash my hands in the sink because it feels like the only polite thing to do. The water is cold and tastes like rust when I rinse my mouth. My gums sting. My head does that slow tilt again, like the world is on a hinge.

In the hallway, I see a pair of flip-flops abandoned by the bathroom door, cheap black rubber with the straps snapped. Someone has left them like a warning. I step around them and head downstairs.

The bar is already awake in its morning skin: lights low, chairs askew, a couple of bodies curled on the couches like they'd been folded there. Kuba is behind the counter, shirt wrinkled, hair standing up, a rag in his hand. He looks up when he sees me.

"You look like you fought gravity and lost," he says.

"Gravity's undefeated," I say, and the words taste like a joke and a prophecy.

He slides a glass of water toward me. It's become a ritual. I drink it in two gulps and feel it hit my empty stomach like a dropped stone.

"Third-floor shower on again," I say.

He doesn't look surprised. "Someone always forgets. Or someone is too drunk to find the tap. Or someone thinks the sound helps them sleep." He shrugs. "I turned one off last night. Nearly slipped. Thought about putting up a sign. Then I remembered we already had one." He nods at the peeling sticker: STAY HYDRATED.

"We need one that says DON'T DIE," I say.

"We had one," he says. "Someone stole it. Hung it in their dorm as art. People like to decorate with warnings." He wipes the counter like he can erase the conversation.

Liv appears at my elbow, hair tied up, face puffy. "You're up early," she says, which is funny because it's already almost noon.

"The shower was on," I say.

"It's haunted," she says, and presses her forehead to the counter. "Do you want coffee or do you want to die?"

"Can I pick both?" I say.

"No," she says, and Kuba sets a mug down in front of her like a peace offering.

I watch the steam rise. The smell of coffee is burnt and bitter. The smell of goulash from the kitchen crawls into the room, heavy and slow. A couple of new arrivals drag themselves in with backpacks, eyes bright and confused. One of them, a skinny bloke with a camera around his neck, asks about showers and Kuba points him upstairs like he's pointing at a cliff.

"Buy shower shoes," I say, because it's the only advice I know.

He laughs. "I've got these," he says, and holds up his socks like he's kidding.

"Good luck," I say. He thinks I'm joking. Maybe I am.

At the far end of the bar, Marta is mopping the same wet line. Her shoulders are hunched, her mouth a straight line. She catches my eye and points at my feet.

"Shoes," she says.

"Later," I say, and she makes a sound like a cough.

We sit at a table with a half bowl of peanuts between us. The peanuts taste stale. I eat them anyway. Liv scrolls through her phone and grimaces.

"My mum wants to FaceTime," she says.

"Tell her you're in a monastery," I say.

"If monks had beer pong," she says, and shows me a photo of a monk statue outside on the street. He's got graffiti on his face that reads PARTY JESUS. She laughs. I laugh. It feels thin.

My phone buzzes. Mum. Miss you. Are you safe? I stare at the screen. My thumb hovers. I type, All good. Just tired. I add a thumbs up because it feels like armor. I hit send. I don't call. The thought of hearing her voice feels like a spotlight.

A British guy with a fresh bandage on his head slumps into a chair across from us. His eyes are glassy, the skin around the bandage pink. He holds a beer like it's medicine.

"Bathroom got me," he says, as if the bathroom is a person who owes him money.

"Pipe?" I ask.

"Nah. Slipped. Smacked the wall. Thought I was sweet till I saw the blood." He taps the bandage. "Marta gave me this and told me to stop bleeding in her bathroom. Fair." He laughs and winces.

"You should probably go to a doctor," Liv says.

"I went to the bar," he says. "Cheaper." He takes a sip. "You lot been here ages. You got shower shoes?"

"We have thongs," I say, and lift my foot. The strap is loose. The sole is thin as paper. It looks like a joke.

"That's not a shoe," he says. "That's a suggestion."

"It's worked so far," I say, which is not the same as a reason.

The bar fills slowly. The day does that slow stretch where everyone is too tired to do anything but drinking. The music is soft, a playlist of nostalgia songs we pretend not to know. A couple of Germans set up beer pong with the slow solemnity of a ritual. Someone writes LIVE FAST on the whiteboard and underlines it twice.

My head swims in a way that's different from the usual. It's not just the hangover. It's like the room is refusing to stay still. I blink. The edges of things blur, then sharpen. I rub my eyes with the heels of my hands. The blur stays for a heartbeat too long.

"You're pale," Liv says.

"That's the Czech winter," I say.

"It's March," she says.

"Exactly," I say, and she doesn't laugh.

I stand to get more water and the floor tilts. I catch the back of the chair and breathe until the tilt passes. Kuba watches me over the rim of a glass.

"You should eat real food," he says.

"I had peanuts," I say.

"Peanuts are a garnish," he says.

I grin because the alternative is admitting he's right. I grab a plate of toast from the kitchen and chew through it even though it tastes like cardboard. It sits in my stomach like a stone.

By mid-afternoon, the rain has stopped. A thin sunlight sneaks through the dusty windows and makes the dust hang in the air like glitter. Someone suggests a walk. No one moves. Someone suggests the basement. Everyone cheers.

We drift down to the cave, the after-hours room in the basement that smells like sweat and stale smoke. The walls are damp. The music is loud. It feels like standing inside a heartbeat. I dance because it's easier than thinking. The floor is sticky with spilled beer. My feet don't slip here. That feels like a blessing.

Halfway through a song, I step outside for air and the cold hits me like a slap. The courtyard is wet and dark, fairy lights dripping rain. A guy is leaning against the wall with a cigarette, a local, maybe, with a face that looks like mornings. He nods at me.

"You still alive," he says.

"Barely," I say.

He flicks ash. "Bathroom still bad?"

"Always," I say.

He laughs once, a short sound. "In my building, we fix things. Here, you drink over them." He gestures at my beer. "You should be careful. The floor there is like ice. The pipe is a knife." He says it like a weather report.

"I'll use the ground floor tomorrow," I say.

"Tomorrow," he repeats, and his eyebrows lift, as if he's tasted that word before. "You tourists love tomorrow." He stubs his cigarette on the wall and walks away.

I stare after him, the word echoing. Tomorrow. The word is soft, forgiving. It's a pillow you can hide in. It's also a trap.

When I go back inside, the music is louder. Someone hands me a shot of something green. I ask what it is. They say, "Luck." I drink it. It tastes like sugar and chemicals and the bad part of a mint.

The room spins. I laugh. I dance. I forget the pipe for a while.

Around four, the music dips and the room exhales. Liv appears at my elbow with her jacket on and a look that says she needs air. I follow because it's easier than saying no. We climb the stairs, past a guy asleep on the landing with his face on his backpack, past the wall of stickers and warnings and joke signs. Outside, the street air is cold and wet, a clean slap. The rain has thinned to a mist. Prague looks like it has been rinsed.\n\n\"We should get water,\" Liv says.\n\n\"We should get a new liver,\" I say.\n\n\"Start with water,\" she says, and we walk toward the corner shop because it is open and because walking feels like penance.\n\nThe cobblestones are slick. My thongs squeak with each step. The city is quiet in that afternoon lull, the tourist crowds thinned by rain. A tram rattles past, bell bright as a warning. My head feels like it's stuffed with cotton. The air is cold enough to make me shiver and the shiver makes me feel briefly alive.\n\nWe stop at a kiosk with plastic rain ponchos and postcards. The same guy from before is there, the one with the shower shoes and the grin. He spots me and lifts a pair of thick rubber sandals like a priest offering a sacrament.\n\n\"Still alive,\" he says.\n\n\"Barely,\" I say.\n\n\"Today is good day,\" he says, and shakes the sandals. They are black, sturdy, with deep treads. They look like something a person who plans to live would buy.\n\n\"How much?\" Liv asks.\n\n\"One fifty,\" he says, tapping a handwritten sign: SHOWER SHOES. SAFE FEET. SAFE LIFE.\n\nLiv looks at me, eyebrow up.\n\n\"Fine,\" I say, because saying no feels like tempting the universe. I hand over the money. The shoes are heavier than I expect, the rubber thick and fresh. The smell of new plastic hits me like childhood.\n\n\"Now you will not die in shower,\" the guy says.\n\n\"No promises,\" I say, and he laughs like it's a joke.\n\nWe walk on. The shoes thump against my thigh in the plastic bag. The bag swings with each step. It feels like a talisman. It also feels like a prop, something I bought because everyone expects the hero to carry the thing that could save him.\n\nAt the convenience shop, the fluorescent light hums. The shelves are lined with energy drinks and instant noodles and tiny first-aid kits in neat rows like little white bricks. I grab a bottle of water, then another. My hand shakes a little when I pay. The cashier doesn't look up.\n\nOutside, I twist the cap and drink. The water is cold enough to make my teeth ache. It slides into my stomach and the ache there dulls. The bag with the shoes swings again. My fingers are numb from the cold.\n\n\"How's your head?\" Liv asks.\n\n\"Loud,\" I say.\n\n\"Not a headache. A noise.\" She taps her temple.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I say. \"Like a fridge that won't stop humming.\"\n\nShe nods, like she understands. \"You should slow down.\"\n\n\"Tomorrow,\" I say.\n\nShe rolls her eyes and doesn't argue.\n\nOn the way back, a guy is hosing down the pavement outside a bar, the water sluicing into the gutter. The hose slips on the slick stone and he curses. The water splashes my feet and I flinch. The sudden cold makes my stomach twist. For a second I see the shower floor, the mold by the drain, the pipe's rusted halo. The image slides away as fast as it came.\n\nAt the hostel gate, a German couple are arguing about a lost phone. A guy in a bathrobe stands barefoot on the step, shaking, his hair dripping. His skin is blotchy, his eyes unfocused. He looks like he's been washed out.\n\n\"You okay?\" I ask.\n\nHe blinks at me. \"Floor,\" he says. \"Slippery.\" He laughs, a thin sound. \"I sat down for a second.\"\n\n\"Don't do that,\" Liv says.\n\n\"I didn't mean to,\" he says, and shuffles past us, leaving wet footprints that disappear as he walks.\n\nInside, the lobby smells like wet coats and citrus cleaner. The bucket under the leak by the stairs is full. Drip. Drip. Drip. The sound is soft and steady, like the shower's quiet cousin.\n\nI carry the new shower shoes upstairs and set the bag on my bunk like it's a trophy. I look at them for a second. They look too sensible. They look like someone else bought them. I push the bag to the side and go back downstairs because the bar is calling and because I don't trust myself to be alone with the noise in my head.\n\nAt the bar, someone has started a drinking game with a deck of cards and a bell. The bell is bright and obnoxious. Every time it rings, my head jumps. I sip water between beers and tell myself I'm balancing. The bag with the shower shoes sits on my bunk, far away, a good intention gathering dust.\n\nAround six, Kuba announces a family dinner. The goulash is thick and salty. I eat a bowl and my stomach stops complaining for a while. The room is warm, the benches crowded, the chatter loud. It feels safe in the way crowds can feel safe, because no one can see you clearly in a crowd.\n\nAfter dinner, I go up to the dorm to grab a hoodie. The hallway is damp. The line of water glistens. The bathroom door is open and a guy I recognize from the morning is arguing with his friend about the shower mat. The mat is gone again, disappeared into someone's room like a relic. My new shower shoes are still on my bunk. I stare at them for a second and then leave them there because I don't want to carry a plastic bag around the bar like I'm grocery shopping.\n\nWhen I get back downstairs, someone is talking about going out. \"Let's do a real pub,\" they say, like the hostel bar isn't real. The idea of more noise makes my head throb, but I say yes anyway because saying no feels like falling out of the story.\n\nWe walk into the evening, a loose pack of drunk tourists. The street is glossy with rain. The city smells like beer and wet stone. We stop at a pub with wooden tables and a sign that says WE SERVE REAL BEER. The beer tastes the same as it does everywhere, but the room is warmer, the lights softer. A Czech bartender smiles like he's seen this before.\n\nI drink. I tell a story about a kangaroo I never met. People laugh. My head swims less with each sip, then more. It's a slow pendulum. In the toilet, I wash my hands and the tap water here is clear and cold. The floor is dry. There is a rubber mat in front of the urinal. I stare at it like it's a miracle.\n\n\"You okay?\" Liv asks when we get back to the table.\n\n\"Yeah,\" I say. \"Just thinking about mats.\"\n\nShe laughs. \"Who are you and what have you done with Brad the Lad?\"\n\n\"He's in the shower,\" I say, and the joke lands weird.\n\nBy the time we head back, the hostel is already loud again. The walk home is a blur of wet cobblestone and neon. My thongs slap the ground. The bag with the shower shoes waits on my bed like a silent witness. I don't look at it when I pass.\n\nWhen I step into the bar, someone shouts my name. A shot is pressed into my hand. I drink it because it's there.\n\nLater, upstairs, the hallway is humid, the air thick with damp clothes and bodies. The line of water is there, brighter in the emergency light, a polished ribbon down the hall. I step over it, careful, and my foot still slips a fraction. My shoulder bumps the wall. I laugh under my breath, because if I don't laugh I might curse and then I'd have to admit it's not funny.\n*** End Patch"}}అ<commentary to=functions.apply_patch +天天中彩票 尚度ed code block with JSON>Okay, I need to use the apply_patch tool directly with a patch, not JSON.

Later, upstairs, the hallway is humid, the air thick with damp clothes and bodies. The line of water is there, brighter in the emergency light, a polished ribbon down the hall. I step over it, careful, and my foot still slips a fraction. My shoulder bumps the wall. I laugh under my breath, because if I don't laugh I might curse and then I'd have to admit it's not funny.

The bathroom door is open. The flicker inside is slower, like the bulb is dying. I can hear the shower running again, that same steady hiss. It's on and no one is in it. Or maybe someone is, and they're just not making noise. The idea makes my stomach tighten.

"Hello?" I call from the doorway.

No answer. The water keeps running.

I step inside, careful. The floor is wet and slick. The smell is stronger, mildew and something metallic. The second stall, the bad one, is on. Water pools at my feet. The pipe gleams. The wall stain looks darker, as if the wall decided to remember again.

I turn the tap off. Silence floods the room. The drain gurgles and seems to sigh. I stand there with my hand on the cold metal, wet water dripping off my wrist, and I feel a sudden, irrational anger at the room. At the pipe. At the way everyone shrugs and says, "That's Mad House." At the way I keep saying tomorrow.

"You're trying to kill someone," I say to the pipe. My voice echoes. It sounds smaller than I want it to.

In the mirror, I catch my own eyes. They look glassy. The skin around them is grey, like smoke. I blink and the reflection lags behind by half a second. The lag is just enough to make my chest go cold.

I splash water on my face. It's cold, sharp, real. It doesn't fix the lag. I dry my face on my sleeve and back out of the bathroom like I'm leaving a cage.

In the hallway, a couple of Brits are arguing about whose turn it is to shower. One of them is holding a rubber bath mat like it's a prize. He found it in a closet somewhere, he says, like he's discovered treasure.

"Where'd you get that?" I ask.

"Laundry room," he says. "Don't tell anyone." He grins like a thief.

"You're a hero," I say.

He laughs and goes into the bathroom with the mat under his arm. I watch him disappear and wonder if he'll leave it there for the next person or take it like a souvenir. This place turns safety into a game. Everything is a game until it isn't.

Back in the dorm, I sit on my bunk and scroll through my phone. My sister has sent another voice note. I press play. Her voice fills the room, soft and sharp.

"Brad, Mum isn't sleeping. She keeps checking her phone at night. She's not going to stop until you call. Please. Just call her. Or call me. I don't care. I just need to know you're okay." Her voice cracks on the last word.

I stare at the screen after the voice ends. The dorm is quiet except for the snore above me and the distant bass from downstairs. The air smells like damp socks and stale beer. I could call. It would take two minutes. It would make her sleep. It would make me feel worse. My chest tightens. I put the phone face down.

Outside, a shout goes up, then laughter. The hostel keeps chewing time.

By evening, the bar is full again. The themed night is something like "Czech school spirit" which means everyone has scribbled fake grades on their arms and someone is dressed as a teacher with a yardstick. The music is louder. The lights are warmer. The energy is frantic, like a party trying to outrun something.

I drink because it's what I do. A beer here, a shot there. The edges of the day blur. I become the version of myself everyone likes: loud, easy, the guy who yells "LET'S GO" at the right time. The anxious version of me curls up in the corner of my chest and whispers that the floor is wet, the pipe is there, the shower keeps running, and no one checks.

At some point, someone says, "Who's in the bathroom?" and no one answers. We all laugh like it's a bit. It isn't. I look toward the stairs and feel that slow tilt again. I steady myself on the bar. The wood is sticky. The world is warm and loud and slick.

Later, outside in the courtyard, the rain has started again. It makes the fairy lights into tiny suns. The wet air smells like stone. Liv leans against me, warm and heavy.

"You're quiet," she says.

"Just tired," I say.

"You should sleep," she says. "For real. Sleep before." She grins because it's a joke, but it's also a plea.

"Tomorrow," I say.

She looks at me. "You always say that."

"I'm a tomorrow kind of guy," I say, and try to make it funny.

She doesn't laugh. "Maybe try today."

I want to say yes. I want to say I'm done. I want to say I'll call Mum and use the ground floor shower and drink water and stop before the edge. But the words stick. Instead I lift my beer. "Cheers," I say.

She clinks her cup to mine. The rain keeps falling.

When I go upstairs, the hallway is empty. The emergency light hums. The line of water shines. The bathroom door is closed and the light flickers beneath it, like a pulse. The sound of running water is gone, which feels like a relief and a warning.

I stop outside the door anyway. The wood is damp under my palm. I feel the slow sway in my head, the soft wave. I could use the sink, wash my face, brush my teeth, pretend it's a ritual of health. Or I could do what I keep promising and use the ground floor shower, if it's open, if it's clean, if I can walk down the stairs without the building rocking.

"Tomorrow," I whisper. The word is a blanket.

I go to bed instead. The dorm is warm, too warm, the air thick with other people's sleep. I climb into my bunk and lie on my back. The mattress is thin. The springs press into my shoulder blades like fingers. The room spins a little, then steadies.

Somewhere down the hall, a shower turns on. The water hits concrete. The sound is soft and steady and familiar. I close my eyes and the sound fills my skull, water in a metal bucket, rain on a tin roof, a heartbeat you can't quiet.

"Morning shower," I tell myself, because it's the only plan I know. "Ground floor. Careful. Call Mum." The promises line up like empty bottles.

The water keeps running.
