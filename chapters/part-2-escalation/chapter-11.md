# Chapter 11: The Red Mark

The first thing I see is a handprint on the shower wall.

At least I think it is a handprint. The light is doing its flicker-think-flicker thing, and the stain is too dark to be rust and too light to be fresh blood. It looks like someone pressed their palm into the tiles and dragged it down, a smear that stops right at the copper pipe like it got interrupted. The fingers are there, five of them, splayed, and the thumb is bent in that hitchhiker angle that makes my stomach go small.

I stand in the doorway with my towel on my shoulder and my head floating somewhere near the ceiling. My mouth is dry enough to crack. My tongue tastes like old absinthe and cheap lime. I blink hard. The handprint stays. I blink again. It still stays.

Someone has bled in here. Recently, or not so recently. Hard to tell in Mad House, where the grime is layered like a cake and every surface has a history. I take a step in and the floor gives a wet sound, the suction of my foot trying to let go of the concrete. The air is warm and sweet with mildew. The drain gurgles like it knows a secret.

"That's new," I say to the room, because if I say it out loud it becomes a joke instead of a warning.

The mirror above the sinks is fogged, my face a ghost behind the steam. The smiley face someone drew yesterday is gone. The light buzzes. The pipe in the second stall gleams even in the dim, a cold little line at head height. The handprint is just to the right of it, a smear that looks like a wave breaking on a rock.

I shouldn't care. It's not my blood. It's not my story. It is just another stain in a place that collects them. If anything, it fits the vibe. The hostel is a museum of other people's bad decisions. A dried smear doesn't change that.

"Wild night for someone," I mutter, and it sounds like a reason.

I don't shower. Not yet. I just wash my face, because it feels like the only polite thing to do when your head is full of bees. The water comes out cold, stings my cheeks, and smells like metal. I cup it and splash, and the drops hit the sink with a soft, impatient sound. The handprint stays in the corner of my eye. I don't look directly at it. Looking directly makes it too real.

A door clicks behind me. A guy I don't recognize brushes past, towel around his waist, hair dripping. He sees the handprint and tilts his head.

"That paint?" he asks.

"Yeah," I say, because maybe it is paint.

He shrugs and goes to the sink, too tired to care. We are all too tired to care. That is how we survive here.

I dry my face on my shirt because my towel feels too good to use. The shirt smells like smoke and yesterday. I turn off the tap, step back, and catch my reflection. My eyes are red and too bright. There's a new bruise on my forearm, yellowing at the edges, no idea where it came from. My hair sticks up in damp tufts, bleached tips like burnt straw.

I leave the bathroom with my head down, as if the handprint could see me leaving. The hallway is cold and damp, the thin line of water still there like a low tide mark. Marta is mopping again, because time is a circle in this place. She doesn't look up.

"Someone bleeding in there," I say, pointing a thumb back. It comes out casual, like gossip.

"Always someone bleeding," she says, and the mop slaps the floor like a tired applause.

"They okay?"

She shrugs. "If not, they go hospital. If not, they go home. If not, they go away." Her voice is flat as the tile.

It's a grim little rhyme. I laugh because it's easier. "Good morning to you too, Marta."

She smirks in a way that might be a smile if you squint. "Morning, Brad. Don't fall."

"Me? Never," I say, and step around the wet line like a man who believes his own jokes.

Back in the dorm, the air is thicker than the hallway, heavy with sleep and stale beer. Someone's phone is buzzing under their pillow, a tiny bee trapped in fabric. The bucket in the corner is half full. The room smells like sweat and cheap deodorant and the faint sour tang of whatever passed through the bucket last night. I sit on my bunk and stare at my phone. Two messages. Mum: How's Prague today? Sister: You alive?

I type back the version of myself that doesn't exist. Great. All good. Busy. I add a laughing emoji to my sister because it's safer than honesty. The blue ticks appear. I feel the usual pinch in my chest, the thin needle of guilt I keep ignoring.

I stretch, wince, and the ceiling sways a little. My head is a house with every window open. The cold air in the hallway feels like a promise: if I move, maybe it stops hurting. I pull on my shorts and singlet, slide my thongs on, and head downstairs to the bar.

The bar is in its morning skin: lights low, music a soft thump, chairs still crooked from last night. Kuba is behind the counter with a rag and a look that says he hasn't slept but he also hasn't stopped. He slides a glass of water toward me without asking.

"You look like a haunted mop," he says.

"I feel like one," I say, and drink. The water is too cold and it hits my stomach like a rock.

He pours coffee. It smells like burnt earth. "Big night?"

"All nights are big nights," I say.

He nods. "You seen the bathroom?"

"The handprint?" I ask, and his eyebrow twitches like I said something rude.

"Yeah. Someone banged their head. Marta will scrub it later. Or not. Depends on mood."

"Who?"

"No idea. You were there, mate." He grins because it's a joke. I grin because it's probably true. We both laugh and it feels like letting air out of a balloon.

Liv slides onto the stool next to me with a groan. Her hair is a mess, eyes small and puffy. She looks at my coffee like it is an enemy.

"Who died?" she asks.

"Not us," I say.

"Yet," she says, and flicks her eyes toward the hallway as if the bathrooms can hear us. She reaches for my water and takes a sip.

We sit in the quiet, letting the caffeine climb. The smell of goulash starts to creep in from the kitchen, heavy and comforting. Outside, the street is wet. A tram clatters past, bell bright and cheerful in a way that feels like mockery. People in coats move with purpose. They are going to jobs, to schools, to places where the floors are dry.

A couple of new arrivals shuffle in with backpacks, eyes bright and a little lost. One of them has a towel draped over his shoulder, a hopeful look on his face.

"Showers this way?" he asks.

"Upstairs, third floor," I say. "They're a bit dodgy. Wear thongs."

He laughs. "It's just a shower."

"Yeah," I say. "Just a shower."

He goes upstairs anyway. I watch him go, the bounce in his step. I remember that bounce in myself. It feels like a different life.

Liv leans her head on my shoulder, heavy and warm. "You're quiet," she says.

"Just tired," I say. "Mate, I saw a bloody handprint in the shower this morning."

She lifts her head, eyes narrowing. "Oh, that. Yeah, I saw it last night. I thought it was sauce from someone's kebab."

"Sauce at head height?"

"Could be a tall guy," she says, and we both laugh because this place makes the absurd sound normal.

I want to say more, to tell her it looked like someone reached out for the wall and slid down, to say it made my stomach go cold even through the hangover. Instead I drink my coffee and let the bitterness burn the words away.

After breakfast I head upstairs to grab a hoodie. The hallway is quieter now, the kind of quiet that makes you hear the building thinking. The light above the third floor flickers and steadies like a tired eye. The wet line in the hall has thinned, but it still shines. I step over it and feel the slight give of the damp under my thong. My foot skates a centimeter. I catch myself on the wall and pretend it didn't happen.

The bathroom door is open. I can hear someone inside, a low groan, the sound of a body negotiating gravity. I should keep walking. I don't. I stop in the doorway and lean on the frame.

The handprint is still there. It looks darker now, the edges rougher. Someone has tried to wipe it and only smeared it wider. The tiles around it are streaked, the color of weak tea. A strip of dried blood runs down the grout like a tiny river. The copper pipe is just above it, a dull finger. The light flickers and makes the stain pulse.

The stall curtain is pulled closed. A pair of feet in flip-flops are visible underneath, toes curled like they're gripping for life. A wet cough. Then the sound of a body shifting. The curtain sticks to skin, a soft slap. The person inside says, "Jesus," under their breath.

"You all right?" I ask, and my voice bounces around the room.

"Yeah," he says, breathy. "Just slipped a bit. Floor's a joke."

I look at the handprint again. "Nearly everyone does," I say.

He laughs, then winces. "Did someone bleed there?"

"Maybe," I say. "Probably just some sauce."

"Mate," he says, and laughs again. "Yeah, all good. Just sauce."

I leave him to it and step back into the hall. The air feels colder. The line of water glints. Marta is at the far end with her mop, dragging the same wet arc over the same stubborn line.

"Bathroom still gross?" I call.

She doesn't look up. "Always gross."

"Someone left a handprint. Like blood."

She pauses, wrings the mop. "Maybe blood. Maybe makeup. Maybe fake." She shrugs. "It all same when it dry."

It's a sentence that makes my stomach turn, not because it's dramatic but because it's true. In this place, everything dries into the same color. I nod like it's fine and keep walking.

In the dorm, I grab my hoodie and sit on the edge of my bunk for a second. The room is empty except for a German guy snoring in the top bunk, his mouth open like a trap. The window is fogged. The air smells like damp cloth. My phone buzzes. Another message from Mum: You eating okay? I stare at it, thumb hovering. I could tell her about the handprint, about the way my balance keeps slipping on the wet line in the hallway. I type, Yeah, lots, hostel food is hectic, and delete the last part because it's too honest. I hit send.

I lie back for a minute and let the mattress take me. The ceiling wobbles. The sound of the shower starts up in the bathroom, the rush of water through old pipes. It sounds like a throat clearing, like a building trying to swallow. I close my eyes and think about the Gold Coast, about the shower at Mum's place that always ran too hot, about the way she'd yell at me for taking too long. I used to turn the water off and listen to her footsteps in the hallway, the soft thud of slippers. I used to pretend I was asleep so she'd stop worrying.

Here, there is no one to worry except me. The thought is colder than the hallway.

After breakfast, the day stretches out like a bad joke. Recovery drinks at noon, because it's always noon somewhere. We play a lazy game of cards. Someone loses, someone strips. The bar fills with slow laughter. The shame board gets a new photo of a guy asleep in the kitchen sink. We tape it up like a trophy.

In the afternoon, Liv and I decide to be tourists again, like yesterday never happened. We walk toward Old Town because the hostel brochure says you should and because it is better than sitting in the bar watching the clock. The air outside is cold enough to make my breath white. The cobblestones are slick and uneven, the kind of street that makes you look down when you should be looking up. My foot slides once and I catch myself, a little jolt up my spine.

"Careful," Liv says.

"I'm just testing gravity," I say.

"Gravity always passes," she says.

We find a trdelnik stand and burn our fingers on sugar. The cinnamon tastes like Christmas and the tourists taste like sweat. A Czech kid zooms past on a scooter and nearly clips my shin. I flinch and feel my pulse spike. Everything feels a fraction too close today, like the world is leaning in.

On Charles Bridge, the wind is sharp and the river looks like a strip of oil. A busker plays accordion and the notes flutter like a tired bird. I lean on the stone and look down. The water makes me dizzy. I step back and pretend I'm just adjusting my jacket. Liv sees it anyway.

"You okay?" she asks.

"Just hungover," I say. "Standard."

She gives me that look again, the one that is half concern and half understanding. "You should drink water."

"I'll drink water later," I say, which is a lie I have told a thousand times.

We cross the bridge and wander through the market stalls. I buy a cheap beanie I don't need and tell myself it's for warmth. The vendor calls me "bro" in English. Prague is a machine for tourists and we are the coins.

We duck into a convenience shop for water and end up buying everything but. The fluorescent light hums like an insect. I pick up a bottle of sports drink, neon blue, promising electrolytes and redemption. The cashier is a teenage girl with a nose ring and a bored look. Behind her, a shelf of first-aid kits lines up like tiny white coffins. Gauze. Bandages. A little red cross on each box. I stare too long and she raises an eyebrow.

"You bleeding?" she asks in accented English.

"Not yet," I say, because it's a joke. She doesn't smile.

Outside, I crack the sports drink and take a swig. It tastes like melted ice blocks from my childhood. The sugar hits my tongue and my stomach clenches. Liv sips her water and watches me like I'm a lab experiment.

"You ever get scared you're going to die?" she asks, out of nowhere, like a kid testing a swear word.

"All the time," I say, then laugh to make it lighter. "Only when I'm sober."

She smiles but it's thin. "My mate died last year," she says. "Not like this. Car crash. We all thought he was invincible."

I don't know what to do with that, so I nod. The street around us keeps moving. A tram bell rings. A couple pushes a stroller past us. The world doesn't slow down for the sentence she just dropped between us.

"Sorry," she says. "That was dark."

"This place is dark," I say, and I think about the handprint, about the line of water in the hallway, about the way the bathroom light flickers like a warning.

We walk back in a quieter mood. The city looks different when you look at it through that lens. The cobblestones feel sharper. The river smells colder. A statue on a corner stares at us with a face worn blank by weather, and for a second I feel like I'm walking through a museum of deaths I haven't had yet.

At a crossing, the light turns red. I step back without thinking and my heel catches a raised stone. I wobble, arms out, and catch myself on Liv's shoulder. She steadies me. Her hand is warm on my arm.

"You all right?" she asks.

"Yeah," I say. "Just clumsy."

"You're not usually clumsy," she says, but she doesn't push it. We both know what the clumsiness is. We both pretend it isn't.

We pass a pharmacy with a green neon cross. The window is full of vitamins and cough syrup and a poster for flu shots. The cross blinks like a heartbeat. I think about going in, about asking for something to make the pounding stop, but I keep walking. The idea of a pharmacy feels like an admission.

By the time we get back, the hostel is changing skins again. The music gets louder. The bar lights turn warmer. The air thickens with bodies and anticipation. The line of water in the hallway is still there. It seems thinner, like it's been trying to evaporate all day and failing. The handprint in the shower is still there too, I can see it when the bathroom door opens. It's lighter now, fading into the wall like a ghost that doesn't want to be noticed.

I try not to stare. I fail.

At dinner, the goulash is salty and sits heavy in my stomach. Kuba does a toast to "another day without dying" and we all cheer like it is a prayer. Someone starts a beer pong tournament. I line up a shot, my vision a little soft at the edges. The ball arcs, hits the rim, and drops into the cup anyway. The room roars. I roar with it. The noise feels good.

Later, we end up in the courtyard, smoke and fairy lights and laughter. The dog wanders through, tail wagging, and someone gives it a strip of sausage. I scratch its head and it licks my hand, the trust of an animal that doesn't know we are all a little bit broken.

A guy from downstairs, a local maybe, leans against the fountain and lights a cigarette. He's older than most of us, late twenties or early thirties, with a face that looks like it has seen too many mornings. He nods at me.

"You're here long time, yeah?" he asks.

"Couple weeks," I say.

He makes a sound that could be approval or warning. "Bathroom is bad."

"Tell me something I don't know," I say, and lift my beer.

He shrugs. "They don't fix things. People fall."

"People fall everywhere," I say. "It's a hostel."

He blows smoke, watches it curl. "In my village, my uncle put a rubber mat. Cost nothing. Here, they say it kills the vibe."

"We like living on the edge," I say, because that's the line. Because it gets a laugh. Because the truth is too heavy for a courtyard full of smoke.

He looks at me for a second longer than necessary. "Edge is fine until you go over," he says.

"We'll be right," I say, and clink my cup to his. He doesn't smile.

I walk away with the taste of his words in my mouth. I tell myself he's just a local grump, someone who doesn't get the fun of it. I tell myself the handprint was just a messy accident. I tell myself I'm careful, that I wear thongs, that I know the floor is slick. I tell myself a lot of things.

By midnight, the basement is open, the rage cage alive with bass. The air down there is warm and damp, the walls sweating. We dance in a crowd, bodies bumping, laughter too loud. Someone spills beer on my foot. The floor is sticky. My shirt sticks to my back. The music vibrates my teeth. It is the only time my head feels quiet, the only time the noise outside matches the noise inside.

Around two, I slip out for air. The stairwell is cooler, the sound of the bass muffled behind me like a heartbeat through a wall. The hallway on the third floor is empty, the emergency light turning everything green and sick. The wet floor sign is on its side again. I step around it. My foot slides a little on the damp, a gentle reminder. I laugh under my breath.

The bathroom door is ajar. The light inside flickers. The air smells like mildew and something metallic. I should keep walking. Instead I push it open with my shoulder and step in.

The handprint is still there. It has dried darker now, a rusted brown. It sits just above the pipe, like a warning label. The drain is clogged and water pools in the corner, reflecting the flickering light. A strip of toilet paper clings to the wall, wet and translucent.

I stand there, listening to the drip from a shower that someone forgot to shut off. Drip. Drip. Drip. The sound feels like a countdown. I tell myself it's fine. I tell myself the hostel has been here forever. I tell myself I've been here two weeks and I'm still in one piece.

The mirror catches my eye. I look pale in it, a face floating in fog. My pupils are wide. My lips look too red. I run the tap and splash my face, cold water shocking me. The handprint blurs in my peripheral vision. It looks like a warning you can't wash away.

"Just paint," I tell myself.

I turn off the tap, wipe my face on my sleeve, and lean over the sink to spit. The sound echoes in the room. The drip keeps time. Somewhere downstairs, someone laughs. Upstairs, someone snores. The building breathes.

I stand there longer than I mean to, listening. The shower pipes tick as they cool, a soft metal settling. The light buzzes like a fly trapped in a jar. I run my fingers along the edge of the sink and feel the grit in the enamel, the way the water has eaten at it. The handprint sits on the wall like a bruise you keep touching. I imagine Marta scrubbing it tomorrow, her face blank, her mop leaving a pale smear. I imagine it never quite going away, the stain living here longer than any of us.

I could shower now. The water is right there. The floor is slick but I know where the worst spots are. I could keep one hand on the wall. I could be careful. I could be fine.

I look at the handprint again. I imagine the moment behind it: a slip, a reach, a palm sliding down wet tile. I imagine the sound of a head hitting pipe, the soft wet crack. My stomach twists. I laugh, loud and sudden, because the thought is too heavy.

"Not tonight," I say to the empty room, and it sounds like a promise.

I go back into the hallway, the floor cold under my feet. The line of water shines in the emergency light, thin and stubborn. I step over it like it's a snake.

In the dorm, I climb into my bunk and lie on my back. The mattress sticks to my skin. The room smells like feet and beer and laundry that never dries. I close my eyes and the handprint stays, a dark shape behind my lids. The drip in the bathroom runs in my ears. Drip. Drip. Drip.

I think about the local's words, about the mat that costs nothing, about edges and going over. I think about Mum's messages, about my sister's last call, about the way Liv looked at me on the bridge.

"Tomorrow," I whisper. "Morning shower. Easy."

The words float in the dark. I believe them for a second, which is all I need to fall asleep.
