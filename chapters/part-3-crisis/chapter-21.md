# Chapter 21: The Leak That Wouldn't Quit

Water wakes me up by landing on my face like a slap.

Cold, metallic, a drip that doesn't belong in my bunk. I blink hard, swallow, and taste pennies. The ceiling above my bed is stained the color of old tea. A fresh drop swells on the plaster, trembles, then lets go and hits my cheekbone. The room is dim, the night-curtain light of late morning leaking in through the crooked blinds. Someone snores like a lawn mower. My mouth is a desert. My tongue feels too big for my skull. My head is a drum.

Another drop hits my forehead. Then another. It starts to feel personal.

I sit up too fast. The room spins. The spinning isn't a surprise anymore; it's my baseline. I smack the wall, steady myself, and look around for the culprit. No one is awake enough to be peeing off a bunk. The only moving thing is the drip. It lands on my chest now, cold and slow, like a tiny, persistent finger.

"Oi," I mutter, and my voice is a rasp. I swing my legs out of bed. The broken sandal is still broken. The strap snapped last night in the hallway and now lies there like a dead worm. I step over it and put bare feet on the floor. The floor is chilly and a little damp. The damp isn't new. It is, apparently, part of the furniture.

The dripping gets worse in the doorway. There's a wet line creeping along the hall, a dark stripe in the green emergency light. It gleams like a trail of slime in a horror film, the kind that tells you something is behind the wall.

It's coming from the bathroom.

The third-floor bathroom is never quiet. It's always dripping or hissing or rattling. But this is different. This is a steady, hungry sound, the kind you get when the ocean is right there but you can't see it. I follow it because that's what I do. Curiosity is my only exercise.

The door is ajar. Warm, wet air pours out. The smell hits me hard: mildew, old soap, something sweetly sour. I pause, hand on the frame, and the memory of the ambulance flashes in my head — that silver blanket, the bandage, the word pipe. I should turn around. I should be sensible. I should shower on the second floor where the light doesn't flicker and the floor isn't missing chunks.

But the drip is from this bathroom. The drip is on my face.

I step inside.

The floor is a shallow lake. It reaches my ankles in places. The water is cloudy, a mix of old soap and whatever else people left in here last night. There are bubbles hugging the edges, like the last sighs of last night's shower. The drain is underwater and whining, a clogged, old-man sound. One of the showerheads is still running, the water spraying in a hard, pathetic stream at the wall. Someone has left it on, or it didn't shut off properly. The sound fills the room.

I take one step and the floor shifts under me. Not because it actually moves — because it's so slick my feet might as well be on ice. I grab the sink and steady myself.

"Seriously?" I say to no one.

There's a mop in the corner, its head the color of despair. A bucket sits beside it, half full of grey water that looks like coffee left out too long. Marta probably left it after her early shift. Or last night. Marta always leaves a mop, like a warning or an invitation.

This is the first real problem of the day. Not a hangover, not a text from Mum I won't answer. A problem that drips on my face and makes the room smell like a swamp. The kind of problem that makes you think you can fix it if you just try hard enough.

I roll my shoulders, crack my neck, and pretend I'm an adult. "Righto," I whisper. "Let's sort this."

I wade toward the shower and turn the knob. The water stutters and stops. The room goes quiet except for the drain's gurgle and the distant thump of bass downstairs. I crouch and peer into the drain. It's stuffed with hair, grey slime, and something that looks like a strip of cloth. Someone's sock? The smell is ripe. I gag, once. The gag turns into a cough. The cough turns into a laugh because of course it does.

I reach in. The water is cold and slick and smells like wet dog. My fingers find the blockage and I pull. It comes up in a long, disgusting chain: hair, lint, a used band-aid, a piece of plastic, a red straw. It's so gross my stomach does a slow roll. I drop it in the bucket and the water splashes, a tiny wave of filth. The drain sucks at the air like a relieved sigh.

"There," I say. "Look at me, fixing the world."

The water starts to swirl. Slow at first, then faster. The lake shrinks. The wet line in the hallway will dry. The drip on my bed will stop. I feel a ridiculous surge of pride, like I've just invented fire. The problem was simple. I am simple. Everything is fine.

Then a new surge of water spills across the floor from the far stall. The drain gurgles and slows. The water returns to ankle height.

I stare at the stall. The curtain is half pulled. It twitches like something behind it is breathing. I step closer and yank it open.

The shower is running again.

I twist the knob off. It keeps running. I twist it harder. It squeals. It keeps running. The knob spins like a toy. The water doesn't care.

"Oh, come on," I say. I slap the wall. The pipe above the knob rattles. I look at it, the exposed copper, and the memory of the guy on the stretcher hits me again. The pipe gleams in the light like a teeth-bared grin. I reach up and tap it with two fingers. It's warm. Everything in here is warm and wet and wrong.

"Brad, you idiot," I whisper. The room doesn't answer.

I could go get Kuba. I could go find Filip. I could stop pretending I'm the maintenance guy. But then I'd have to explain why I'm barefoot, why I'm in the bathroom at ten in the morning with my hands full of hair. I'd have to look like the guy who can't even keep water off his face.

So I do the thing I always do. I try to fix it myself.

I pull the knob off. It comes away with a wet pop. Behind it, the metal is corroded, green with age. I jiggle it, twist it, tap it with my thumb like it's an old TV that needs a kick. The water sputters, slows, then resumes. It refuses to stop.

"Fine," I say. "Have your fun."

I move the mop into the stream and wedge it against the pipe so the water hits the mop head instead of the wall. It doesn't actually help, but it feels like something. The mop absorbs water, sags, and droops like a wet animal. It looks like me.

I push the mop toward the drain, trying to squeegee the water along. The floor is too slick. The water doesn't want to be corralled. It spreads, taking the easy path, which is the path across the room, toward the hallway, toward my bed. It's like the water is trying to escape.

My head pounds. My stomach threatens. The smell of mildew is starting to feel like it's coating my teeth. I need a shower. I need a cold blast to reset the world. I need to rinse the sweat and beer and smoke off my skin. I need to look like less of a mess before the recovery session starts downstairs. I need to keep my job as a legend.

"I'll just..." I say. I don't know who I'm talking to.

My towel hangs on the hook by the door. Or it did last night. Now it's gone. The hook is bare. The plastic mat I stole from reception is also gone. I look around. It's not on the floor. It's not in the stall. It's not in the corner. Someone took it. The hostel eats things. It eats mats and towels and people.

I stand in the middle of the flooded bathroom and feel a flare of something close to panic. No towel, no mat, no dry floor, broken knob. The problem just became a bigger problem.

Then the panic dies, replaced by the familiar, stupid optimism. I can fix this. I can improvise. I'm a backpacker. Improvisation is my religion.

I could use a spare t-shirt as a mat. I could borrow someone's towel. I could shower on the second floor and pretend I'm responsible. I could do all those things.

Instead I pick up the mop and start mopping.

I spend twenty minutes fighting water like it's a rival in a drinking game. I push the mop toward the drain. I wring it out. I push again. The water drains a little, then surges again because the shower won't stop. The drain gurgles and coughs, the sound of a throat clearing. The mop handle is slick and my hands are pruney already. I'm sweating under the humidity.

Somewhere outside, someone laughs. The sound is muffled through the door, low and carefree. The hostel is awake. The world is moving. I'm stuck in a room with a broken showerhead and a headache that feels like a bad tattoo.

"Hey," a voice says from the doorway. It startles me so hard I nearly slip.

It's Liv, holding a mug of coffee like it's a holy object. Her hair is a nest. Her eyes are red. She takes in the flooded floor, my wet hands, the mop, the shower still running.

"What the hell," she says.

"Morning," I say.

"You look like you fell into the Atlantic." She takes a step back to avoid the water, then points at the knob. "It's stuck?"

"It won't turn off. I'm fixing it."

She makes a face. "You?"

"Yeah, me. I'm handy. I was an apprentice sparky, remember?" I say this like it means I can fix plumbing. It's a lie that sounds good.

She laughs and shakes her head. "You should go get Kuba. Or Marta. Or literally anyone with gloves."

"They're all asleep. Or hungover. I'm on it." I thrust the mop toward her like evidence.

She lifts her coffee to her mouth and watches me like I'm a show. "At least put shoes on."

"I don't have shoes. The thongs died. R.I.P." I say it like a joke. It isn't. My feet are cold and soft and too exposed.

She scans the room. "Your mat?"

"Gone. Stolen. Hostage."

"This place is feral," she says, and there isn't any humor in it.

"Tell me about it." I push the mop toward the drain again. The water swirls, hesitates. It doesn't empty. The mop squeaks on the concrete. My back aches.

Liv sips her coffee and watches in silence for a minute. Then she steps into the room, careful. She crouches and peers at the drain. "There's still junk in it," she says.

"I pulled a whole wig out of it."

"There's more. See?" She points. I bend, squint. She's right. A wad of hair sits just inside the grate like a plug.

"Not touching that," I say.

"You're already touching it," she says.

"Yeah, but there's touching and then there's touching, yeah?" I poke it with the mop handle. It doesn't move. I grimace, reach in, and pull. It comes out with a slurp. I gag and laugh at the same time.

"You're going to get hepatitis," she says.

"I've already got at least three tetanuses," I say. "It's fine."

The water level finally starts to drop. The drain sucks it down with a happy gurgle. The floor is still slick but it's no longer a lake. I stand up, breathless and proud, and spread my arms like I just finished a magic trick.

"See? Sorted." I wipe my wet hands on my shorts. They were dirty anyway.

Liv gives me a look. "Now you just need a shower to wash the shower off."

"That's the plan," I say. "Shower, recovery beer, life goes on."

She steps out, careful not to slip. "Promise me you'll use the second floor."

"Nah," I say, because it's the only word I know how to say when someone asks me to be sensible. "This one's right here. And now it's not flooded."

She opens her mouth to argue, then closes it. Her eyes are tired. Maybe she's done caring. Maybe she knows you can't drag someone out of a habit they're still in love with.

"You're an idiot," she says.

"That's why you like me," I say.

She snorts and leaves. The door swings shut behind her. The room is mine again, damp and echoing. The shower still runs in the far stall. It looks like it's smiling.

I twist the knob again. The water slows, sputters, then resumes. I swear under my breath. The effort has taken whatever energy I had left. The idea of walking to the second floor feels like a pilgrimage. The idea of waiting feels impossible.

I stand there, breathing, and the room breathes with me. The light flickers. The pipe glints. I feel the hangover rising in my throat like a tide.

"I'll fix it later," I tell myself. "Just have a quick rinse."

Quick is a lie. Later is a lie. But they are the lies that keep me moving.

I step out of the bathroom and into the hallway. The line of water is gone now, just a damp shine on the floor. My bed will dry. My face will stop tasting rust. I should feel relieved. Instead I feel hollow, like I just avoided a punch I didn't see.

---

Downstairs, the bar is already alive. Not party-alive, but the low, stubborn hum of morning recovery. The air smells like toast and beer and cleaning spray. Kuba is behind the bar, hair tied back, eyes puffy. He raises a hand when he sees me.

"Morning, legend," he says.

"Morning," I say, and it comes out as a croak.

He slides a glass of water toward me. I stare at it like it's an insult. He slides a beer next to it. We both know which one I'm going to take.

"Water first," he says, pointing.

"Yeah, Dad," I say, and drink the water because my head is splitting.

He leans in. "Bathroom flooded?"

"Fixed it," I say. I say it like I'm proud, which is ridiculous.

"You?" He laughs. "You mop now?"

"I'm a man of many talents."

He whistles low. "Be careful up there. Marta said the knob's broken again." He says it like it's a weather report. Broken knob, chance of rain.

"Already met it," I say.

He shakes his head. "I keep telling Filip to replace the fixtures. He keeps telling me to sell more shots."

"Shower's still running," I say. "Couldn't shut it off." I wait for the reaction. I don't want to ask for help. I want it offered.

Kuba sighs, wipes a glass, and shrugs. "We will get to it later. It's always something."

There it is. That sentence. The one that floats around this place like incense. It's always something. It could be the hostel motto.

I take a sip of beer. The foam clings to my upper lip. The taste is bitter and familiar. My stomach relaxes in gratitude. The first problem of the day is officially filed under not my problem anymore.

Mae slides onto the stool beside me. She looks fresher than she should, hair damp and tied up, skin clean. She smells like actual soap, not regret.

"You showered?" I ask, trying not to sound jealous.

"Second floor," she says. "It was okay. Still gross, but okay." She eyes my wet shorts. "You look like you went swimming."

"Third floor flood," I say. "Fixed it."

"Why did you do that?" she asks, not unkindly.

"It was dripping on my bed."

"So move beds," she says, like it's simple.

"This one is mine. It's got my vibe."

She laughs, then looks at my bare feet. "Where are your thongs?"

"Dead. Murdered in the hallway. RIP to a real one." I lift my foot as if presenting evidence.

She winces. "You can't go barefoot in that bathroom."

"I can if I'm careful."

"Being careful isn't a thing you do," she says, but there is a smile in it. A sad one.

I shrug. "I'm evolving."

She looks over my shoulder at the bar. On the wall behind Kuba, the sign is still there: SHOWER SOBER. DON'T BE A HEADLINE. The skull in the shower cap grins. Someone has added a speech bubble that says, LOL.

Mae follows my gaze. "You really should..."

"I know," I say, because I do. I know in the way you know a speed limit. It's a fact, not a practice.

My phone vibrates on the bar. I flip it over. A text from Mum. Another. I can see the preview without opening it. Call me. Are you okay? I feel my chest tighten. I flip the phone back down. The screen goes dark.

"Everything all right?" Mae asks.

"Yeah," I say. "Just family."

She nods like she understands. Maybe she does. Her eyes are on my hands. They look raw and a bit red from the drain.

"You're bleeding," she says.

I look. A small cut on my knuckle, already sticky. It's nothing. I'm always bleeding. There's always a new scratch. It's part of the uniform.

"It's fine," I say.

She doesn't argue. That's worse somehow. She takes a sip of her coffee and looks away. The bar's noise fills the space between us. Someone cheers from the ping pong table. A spoon clinks against a glass. The day is turning itself over, exposing the soft underbelly of afternoon.

"You doing the recovery crawl?" she asks.

"Yeah, after I clean up. I need a shower."

She exhales through her nose. "Use my towel."

"Nah. I don't want to steal your clean."

"You already stole a mat," she says.

"Fair." I grin. It feels forced. The beer is warming in my stomach, the edges of my hangover softening. Everything is a little easier when you're half drunk.

"Just be careful," she says again.

"Always." I lift my beer. It clinks against her coffee mug. It sounds like a lie.

---

By late afternoon, the bar is thick with bodies. The recovery crawl has turned into a pre-game for the night. It's always pre-game. The sun outside is a pale rumor. The hostel doesn't care about daylight; it runs on beer time.

I play a few rounds of beer pong. I lose on purpose. I laugh too loud. I call people legend and mate and brother. I check my phone once and see a missed call from my sister. I don't call back. I have another beer instead.

At some point, I realize I still haven't showered. The idea sits on my chest like a weight. The smell of myself is starting to bother me, which means it's bad. My skin feels sticky, the kind of sticky that doesn't come off with a towel. My hair is stiff with sweat and smoke.

"Shower time," I announce, like it's a party game.

"You're going to drown in there," Liv says, handing me a beer. She says it like she's joking. She might not be.

"I'll be quick. In and out. Like a robbery," I say.

"Use the second floor," she says.

"Too far," I say.

"You're too lazy to live," she says, smiling.

"That's my charm." I down the beer and head for the stairs.

The stairwell smells like stale smoke and wet socks. The steps tilt slightly, or maybe I do. I hold the rail because my balance is an unreliable friend. My feet are still bare. The hallway on the third floor is quieter now. The line of water is gone. The emergency light hums. The bathroom door is open.

I pause at the threshold. The air inside is humid and warm. The floor gleams. The broken shower still runs, the water hitting the wall in a steady, relentless stream. The sound is a heartbeat that doesn't stop.

"Okay," I say to myself. "This is manageable."

I should go get Kuba. I should shut off the main. I should find my mat. I should do a lot of things.

Instead I step in.

The floor is slick, but not flooded. The drain is working now, slow but doing its job. The water from the broken shower runs across the concrete in a thin sheet, a glassy skin. I step around it like it's a trap. The mold patch near the drain is dark and fuzzy, a little island of green-black that looks almost soft. I avoid it. At least I think I do.

I pull a spare t-shirt out of my bag and lay it on the floor where a mat should be. It gets soaked immediately, clinging to the concrete like a wet newspaper. It's not even a decent substitute. I tell myself it's better than nothing.

I undress. The air is cool against my skin, goosebumps rising. I place my towel — a towel I borrowed from the laundry rack downstairs — on the hook. It looks too clean for this room. The pipe above the shower catches the flicker of the light and throws it back at me like a warning.

"Don't be a headline," I whisper. I can't tell if I'm laughing.

I step in and turn on the water in the stall that actually works. It starts cold, then grudgingly warms. The spray hits my shoulders, and for a moment my head clears. The sound of water is calming. It reminds me of home, of the Gold Coast surf, of salt on my skin and a sun that doesn't flicker.

My foot slides a little. Not much. Just enough to raise the hair on my arms. I shift my weight and press my palm against the wall. The tile is slick. My hand slips. I curse and laugh at the same time.

"All good," I say. "All good."

I soap up quickly. I keep one eye on the drain, one eye on the pipe. The broken shower keeps running in the next stall, making the floor more wet, the air more thick. The room feels smaller. The light flickers, a bad eyelid.

I rinse. The soap goes down the drain in white ribbons. The water swirls around my ankles, warm turning cool as the heater gives up. I shiver. I want to be done.

I reach for the tap to turn the water off. My hand shakes a little. I twist. The water stops with a cough. The silence is sudden and loud. The broken shower still runs, a steady hiss in the background.

I step toward my towel. The t-shirt under my feet is slimy. My toes curl for traction. The concrete is slick, the kind that makes your foot whisper instead of stick. I take another step and my heel skates a fraction.

My heart spikes. It's a tiny slip, nothing, a warning tap on the shoulder. I grab the wall. I steady. I breathe.

"See? Fine," I say to the empty room.

I reach my towel and wrap it around my waist. The cold air makes my skin prickle. I feel better already, like washing off a layer of guilt. I could leave now. I should leave now.

I don't.

I look at the broken shower. I look at the running water. I think about my bed, about the drip, about my knuckles raw in the drain. I think about Kuba's shrug, about Filip's smile, about the word later floating around like a balloon. I think about my name on a waiver. I think about the word headline, the skull's grin.

"Just turn it off," I tell myself. "Just fix it properly."

I step toward the broken stall, towel still on, bare feet on wet concrete. The water is hitting the wall and splashing down, pooling around the drain. The pipe sits above it like a judge.

I reach for the knob. It's slick. My hand slips. I grip harder. The knob spins without catching. I twist, pull, push. The water stutters, then resumes. The pipe rattles, a hollow clink.

"Come on," I say, teeth clenched.

The floor under me is wet with a thin film of soap and whatever else has been ground into it over the years. It's not even slippery anymore — it's slick, the kind of slick you can't see until you move.

I shift my weight to get a better angle. My right foot finds the edge of the mold patch. It feels soft, almost velvety. It moves under my sole.

My stomach drops.

Not yet. Not now. Not like this. I tell myself I can fix it. I tell myself I can hold the wall and pull my foot back. I tell myself it's fine.

The light flickers once. The pipe glints. The water keeps running.

Behind me, in the hallway, someone laughs.

I don't let go of the knob. I don't take my foot off the mold. I don't do any of the sensible things. I just stand there, holding on to a broken thing and telling myself I can make it work.

The floor answers in a slow, wet slide.
