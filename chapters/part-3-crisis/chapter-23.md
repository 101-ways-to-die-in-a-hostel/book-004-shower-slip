# Chapter 23: The Hiss

The shower is in my dreams before it's in my ears.

It is not a sound you can ignore, not once you have heard it for sixteen hours straight. It hisses like a snake in a wall, like a tire losing air, like a secret that keeps trying to get out. In the dream, it becomes the ocean. In the dream, I am back on the Gold Coast and the water is warm and forgiving. Then I wake up and it is cold Czech water hitting a concrete wall in a room that smells like mildew and piss.

My mouth is open when I wake. My tongue is a strip of leather. My skull feels like it is full of pennies. I blink and the room wobbles. Someone is snoring, deep and wet. Someone else is breathing like they're running. The morning light is a thin, gray smear through the blinds. The air is stale. The floor is cold. The hiss is constant.

I roll onto my side and the ache in my hand wakes up too. The bandage is stuck to the cut, dried blood gluing it to my skin. I peel it off and the skin comes away with it. The pain is small but sharp, like a reminder flicked at my wrist. I hiss back, which feels fair.

"Sleep when I'm dead," I mumble into the pillow. It's a joke, but it doesn't feel like one. It feels like a dare from something I can't see.

I sit up slow, because the room tilts if I don't. There are beer cans under the bed, a pile of damp clothes on the chair, and a towel that isn't mine on the floor. My phone glows on the bunk above me. I check it. Three missed calls. Five texts. All from Mum. One from my sister. The first message says: Call me. The second says: I'm worried. The third just has a question mark. The one from my sister says: Please answer.

I flip the phone over. The glow dies. It leaves a dark rectangle on my vision.

The hiss is still going. The running shower has been going all night. It's a dumb thing to be mad at, but I am. I'm mad at the shower for being broken. I'm mad at myself for caring. I'm mad at the sound because it is the only thing in this building that never gets drunk and never falls asleep.

I swing my legs off the bunk and stand. My feet are bare. The floor is cool and faintly sticky. My stomach shifts. The smell of the room is old sweat and old beer and something sweetly rotten from a bin that needs to be emptied. The day is already wrong.

I should get water. I should answer my phone. I should do a lot of things.

Instead I go to the bathroom.

---

The hallway is quiet, the kind of quiet you only get after 4 a.m. when the party has died and the hangovers haven't started screaming yet. The green emergency light makes everything look like it's underwater. I pad down the corridor in my bare feet, the floor tacky with old spills. The hiss grows louder as I get closer to the door.

The bathroom door is open. The light inside flickers. The floor shines. The broken shower is still on, water hitting the wall in a relentless stream that has carved a dark streak down the concrete. The drain gurgles and pulls, slow and exhausted, like it has been swallowing for hours. The mold patch near the drain looks fatter, darker, fed by the constant wet. It looks like something alive.

"Morning," I say to no one. My voice echoes and makes me feel small.

I go straight to the sink. The working one wheezes when I turn the tap. The water is cold, iron-tasting. I fill my hands and splash my face. The cold is a shock and I welcome it. It doesn't make the headache go away, but it makes it feel less personal. I rinse my hand. The cut looks pink and raw, like a mouth that won't close. I let the water run over it and watch the diluted blood thread down the drain.

I glance up at the mirror. The mirror gives me back a version of myself I don't want to know. My eyes are bloodshot and puffy. My skin is grayish under the fluorescents. The bleach in my hair looks like straw. The Southern Cross on my shoulder is faded and bruised. I look like a hangover in human form.

"Legend," I tell my reflection. It doesn't laugh.

The running shower keeps hissing. It sounds like it's asking something. I turn my head toward it and see the pipe above the broken knob. The copper glints. The bracket is rusted and mean. It is a stupid thing to be afraid of, a pipe on a wall, but my palm still remembers the scrape and my shoulder remembers the hit. I rub it without thinking.

I should get shoes. I should get a mat. I should stop using this bathroom.

Instead, I reach for the knob again. It's a habit now, a stupid ritual. I twist. The knob spins without catching. I pull and it slips in my wet fingers. The water sputters, slows for a half second, then resumes like it never heard me. I laugh once, short and sharp.

"You're a stubborn bastard," I say, and it could be about me or the shower.

The door creaks behind me. I startle, then relax when I see Marta. She is in her usual uniform: faded hoodie, mop in hand, face like she woke up annoyed and stayed that way. She looks at the running shower, then at me.

"You again," she says.

"Morning, Marta," I say. "Shower's still running."

"I see." She says it like a judge.

"It's been going all night." I gesture. "Shouldn't we, I don't know, turn it off?"

She shrugs. "Filip says call plumber. Plumber never comes. We mop." She lifts the mop like a weapon. "You mop, too, yes?"

"Yeah," I say. "I'm basically staff at this point."

She looks at my bare feet. "Shoes?"

"Dead," I say.

She snorts, not quite a laugh. "Always dead here. You want sandals?" She points to a plastic crate in the corner. It is full of mismatched flip-flops and random sandals, the hostel's lost-and-found pile of foot bacteria.

I look at them. The thought of putting on someone else's damp flip-flops makes my skin crawl. The thought of walking barefoot in this room makes my skull ache. I hesitate. Marta watches me with the flat patience of someone who has seen a thousand versions of me.

"Take," she says. "No one claim."

I dig through the pile. I find a pair of black rubber flip-flops that almost match. One has a chewed strap. The other smells like old beer. I put them on. The rubber is too soft and too slick, but it's something between my skin and the concrete. It feels like a tiny upgrade in safety.

"Thanks," I say.

Marta grunts and starts mopping around the running shower with a sigh. The mop head sags and streaks water. She isn't really cleaning, just pushing the wet around so it looks like she did. It's what everyone does here. We push problems around so they look smaller.

"You should not shower here," she says without looking at me.

"Yeah," I say, and pretend I didn't hear it.

I dry my hands on my shorts and step back into the hallway. The flip-flops squeak on the floor. It is a ridiculous sound, but it makes me feel slightly less like a walking hazard. The hiss follows me down the hall like a whisper.

---

Downstairs, the bar is a graveyard. Half empty glasses on the tables. A few bodies on the couches, twisted like they fell mid-sentence. The music is off. The light is gray and honest. Kuba is behind the bar, counting coins into a tin with a frown.

"Morning, hazard," he says without looking up.

"Morning, Dad," I say. I sit on a stool and rest my head on my hand. My hand hurts. The stool is sticky. Everything in this room is sticky.

Kuba slides a glass of water toward me. I take it. I drink half in one go. It tastes like chlorine and relief. He slides a coffee next to it. The coffee is the kind of instant that tastes like burned dirt. I drink it anyway.

"Shower still on?" he asks.

"Yeah. Marta says plumber never comes."

He sighs, rubs his eyes. "Filip doesn't want to pay. Says it builds character."

"My character is drowning," I say.

He finally looks at me, and his eyes land on my hand. "That still bad?"

"It's fine." I flex my fingers. The tape is gone. The cut is open again.

"Go to pharmacy. Get disinfectant," he says.

"Yeah," I say, which means no.

He taps the bar. "At least get flip-flops."

I lift my foot to show him the mismatched rubber. "Look at me. Responsible."

He nods once, a quick approval. "Good. Use second floor." He says it like he's handing me a task, not advice.

"Of course," I lie.

Kuba goes back to his coins. I stare at the water in my glass and feel it slosh in my stomach. My phone buzzes on the bar. I look at it, then away. The screen lights my face with the blue glow of other people's worry.

Mae comes in from the courtyard, hair damp from the mist. She looks like she slept maybe two hours. She sees the flip-flops and raises her eyebrows.

"You finally got shoes," she says.

"Borrowed," I say.

"Stolen," she says.

"Hostel sharing economy," I say. I grin. It feels thin.

She sits beside me. "You look rough."

"Thanks," I say. "You're glowing."

"It's called dehydration," she says. She takes a sip of water and winces. "Did you answer your mum?"

"Later." I say it like a shield.

She doesn't argue. She just watches me for a moment, like she's trying to see the version of me that isn't performing. It makes my skin itch. I look away.

"We're doing a walk today," she says. "Old Town. Charles Bridge. Not a bar." She says the last bit like a challenge.

"You're on holiday and you want to walk?" I ask. "That's illegal."

She smiles despite herself. "Come. It'll do you good."

Walking feels like climbing a mountain, but the idea of sitting in this bar all day feels worse. My head is already buzzing. Movement might shake some of it loose. It might make me feel human.

"Fine," I say. "But I'm getting trdelnik."

"Deal," she says.

I down the rest of my water. My stomach doesn't love it. I grab my phone and shove it in my pocket without looking at the screen. I stand too fast and the room tilts. I grab the bar. It steadies. I pretend I was just stretching.

Kuba watches me. He doesn't say anything. He doesn't have to.

---

Prague outside is cold and damp, the kind of cold that seeps into your bones no matter how much you drank the night before. The air smells like wet stone and chimney smoke and sweet pastry. The streets are slick with rain. My flip-flops squeak on the cobblestones, a ridiculous sound in a city that looks like a postcard.

We walk through the old town. The buildings are pale and ornate, all arches and statues. The river is gray and heavy. The bridge is full of tourists even in this weather, selfies and umbrellas and street musicians who look like they haven't slept in a week. I fit in.

The cold makes me feel sharper for a while. The hangover retreats to a dull ache. I can almost pretend I'm here for culture. I can almost pretend I'm a normal traveler.

We stop for trdelnik. The sugar burns my tongue. The warm dough fills my stomach with something that isn't beer. It feels good, and that makes me suspicious. I take a photo for my story and caption it something stupid, because that's what I do. The phone buzzes again. I ignore it.

We pass a pharmacy. Mae points. "Go in," she says. "Get disinfectant."

"I will," I say, because it's easier to say yes than to walk in.

She stops and looks at me. "Brad."

It's my name without the joke. It lands different.

"Fine," I say. I push the door open.

Inside, the pharmacy smells like alcohol wipes and a kind of clean that doesn't exist in a hostel. The shelves are neat. The pharmacist looks up and smiles politely. I feel underdressed, underclean, under everything. I ask for disinfectant in the kind of English that makes me sound like an idiot. She hands me a small bottle and a pack of gauze. I pay and leave quickly, like I've stolen something.

Outside, Mae nods. "See? Adult." She says it like a tease.

"Don't get used to it," I say. I shove the supplies into my pocket.

We keep walking. The cold moves into my joints. My shoulder aches. My hand throbs under the bandage. My head starts to pulse again. The city is beautiful and I am missing it. Every statue blurs into the next. Every spire looks like a bottle.

We end up in a small square with a pub on the corner. The windows are fogged. The smell of beer drifts out. I stop without thinking. Mae looks at me, then at the pub.

"You said not a bar," I say, preemptively.

She sighs. "Just one. Then back."

"You're a bad influence," I say, and push the door.

Inside, the air is warm and the light is yellow. The Czech beer is cheap and cold and tastes like it was brewed for people like me. One becomes two. Two becomes three. We laugh at something we won't remember. The headache softens. The phone stays silent because I keep it face down.

When we leave, the cold hits like a slap. My legs feel loose, not quite steady. The cobblestones are suddenly more complicated. I slip once and catch myself on Mae's shoulder.

"You're fine," she says, but her hand stays at my elbow a second longer than it needs to.

"Just the stones," I say. It's never the stones.

The hostel looms when we get back, its graffiti and neon sign like a dare. The warmth inside is humid and sour. The smell of beer greets us like an old friend.

---

I should go up and sleep. Instead I drift through the bar, because the bar is a current and I am too tired to swim against it. The lights are still low, the music a lazy loop. The morning shift backpacker is wiping tables with a rag that looks like it has seen better war zones. I nod at her. She nods at me. The ritual of pretending to be functional.

On the wall by the staircase is the shame board: a collage of polaroids, black and white, each one labeled with a date and a caption in sharpie. It's supposed to be funny, proof of the party. It's also a museum of unconscious bodies. I can't help looking.

There I am, from two nights ago. I'm on a couch in the chill room, mouth open, a marker moustache on my face. Someone wrote LEGEND in capital letters. I laugh, because that's what you're supposed to do. The laugh feels thin in my throat.

"That's you, yeah?" Mae says behind me.

"No," I say. "That's my twin. Brad Two."

She smiles, but it's tired. "You should be proud. That's like the Nobel Prize in this place."

I should be proud. I am, a little. I am also aware that every photo on that wall is a before photo. The afters are invisible.

I climb the stairs because I can feel the caffeine and beer in my blood wrestling, and I want out of the ring. The third-floor hallway is still damp, the emergency light buzzing. The hiss from the bathroom is quieter now, muffled, but it is still there. It reminds me of a fridge that won't shut up. It reminds me I didn't fix the problem.

In the dorm, the air is hot and stale. A guy I don't know is asleep on my bed, shoes on, feet hanging off. I stare at him, a flash of annoyance, then let it go. Everyone steals beds here, including me. I grab my hoodie and throw it over him like a blanket because I'm apparently a saint now.

I sit on my own bunk, the top one, and the room tilts. I grip the frame until it steadies. My hand throbs. The disinfectant bottle bumps against my thigh in my pocket. I take it out, squirt some on my cut, and regret it immediately. It burns. I grit my teeth. It smells clean, which is almost upsetting.

My phone vibrates again. I pull it out. My sister has sent another text. This time it's just: Brad? I stare at it for a long time. I type: I'm fine. Busy. Love you. It sits there, unsent, the cursor blinking like a heartbeat. I delete it. I put the phone back. The guilt sits heavy, like a wet towel.

I close my eyes for a second. The hiss floats up from down the hall. I can hear the pipes groan now, the building complaining under the weight of its own water. My head pulses. My stomach gurgles. I consider walking to the second-floor bathroom and rinsing off the city, the pub, the sugar, the sweat.

I stand. The room tips. I sit back down.

In the hallway, a door slams. Someone laughs. Someone coughs. The hostel is already gearing up for the evening. It never really stops.

I go downstairs again because I can't sleep with the hiss in my head. The chill room has two bodies in it now, one on the couch, one on the floor. The floor guy is wearing a shirt that says STAY HYDRATED in big blue letters. The irony is almost too neat. I step over his legs and sit in a chair by the window.

The courtyard outside is wet, a thin sheen on the concrete. The fairy lights are still on even though it's day. The tarp flaps once in the wind like a lazy wave. I pull out my phone, open Instagram, and scroll. My story from last night is there, shaky footage of the basement, a caption: STILL ALIVE. People have reacted with flame emojis and laughing skulls. Someone from Brisbane commented, Legend. Someone else wrote, slow down, mate. I can't tell if it's a joke.

I post a photo of the trdelnik and caption it Food is fuel. It gets five likes in three minutes. It feels like validation and emptiness at the same time. I stare at the screen until my eyes blur. I put it away.

Kuba walks by and pauses. "You alive?" he asks again, like it's a habit.

"Barely," I say.

"Good enough." He points toward the bar. "Family dinner tonight. Goulash. Try to eat."

I nod. Eating feels like effort. My stomach is a washing machine. But I know he's right. Food is fuel. He says it like he's not also serving shots in an hour.

I head up to my room to grab a clean shirt. The hiss is louder now. I pass the bathroom door and, for a second, my feet stop on their own. The sound is warm in my ears, constant. I picture the water hitting the wall, the stream carving its little river, the drain swallowing and failing. I picture the mold patch, dark and soft. I picture the pipe, copper and waiting.

"Not now," I tell myself. "Later. Second floor."

I go to the second floor bathroom to prove I can. It's cleaner, brighter. The light doesn't flicker. The floor is tiled, still wet but not broken. There is a mat in one stall, damp but there. I stand in the doorway and feel a tiny sense of victory. It's ridiculous. It's also real.

I don't shower. I wash my face, run water over my wrists, and tell myself it counts. I tell myself the real shower can wait until the morning, when I'm less drunk, when I'm more responsible. Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow.

On the way back down, I pass Filip in the stairwell. He's carrying a box of beer on his shoulder like it's nothing. He's in his mid-thirties, skin tanned by indoor lighting, a smile that never quite reaches his eyes. He nods at me.

"Brad the Lad," he says. "How's the apocalypse?"

"The shower's still on," I say.

He laughs. "Legendary shower. It's part of the experience."

"It's part of the flood," I say.

"Ah, flood, fire, beer, it's all the same here," he says, and shrugs. "We fix it when season ends."

Season never ends here. It just rolls over.

"All right," I say, because what else is there to say. He passes me on the stairs, the box of beer tilting dangerously, and I watch him go, feeling like I'm watching a man carry gasoline past a burning room.

Back in the bar, the goulash is out. It smells like paprika and onions and the kind of home cooking that makes you miss a home you haven't been to in months. I eat a bowl. It's too hot. It sits heavy in my stomach. It makes me feel slightly more human.

---

Afternoon turns into evening without asking. The bar fills. The music starts. The recovery crowd morphs into the pre-game crowd. The line between them is beer, and we cross it without noticing.

I disinfect my hand in the bathroom and stick a clean bandage on it. It stings and then it doesn't. I look at the running shower and tell myself I won't go in there tonight. I will use the second floor. I will be a responsible adult. I will answer my phone. I will do a lot of things.

Then someone shouts my name and hands me a beer and the list of things I will do gets shorter.

I drink. I laugh. I dance. I avoid the bathroom because I am trying, truly trying, to be the person my mum thinks I am. The night is loud enough that I can ignore the hiss, but I can still feel it under the music like a low note that never goes away.

At some point, Mae leans in and says, "You should call her now."

"Later," I say. I am a broken record.

She shakes her head and goes to dance. I watch her for a minute, then someone yanks me into a drinking game. The shot goes down hot. My stomach flips. The floor tilts. I steady myself on the table and pretend I was just leaning in for the rules.

The bar is too warm. I push into the courtyard for air. The tarp is still there, flapping in the damp wind. The lights are dim. The chairs are wet. I sit and let the cold work on me. The phone buzzes again. I pull it out. The screen shows my sister's name this time, not a text. A call. I stare at it until it stops.

I could call back. I could. The idea makes my chest tighten. I don't call. I put the phone away. The cold air tastes like regret.

"You're up late," a voice says. It's the Polish guy from last night, cigarette in hand.

"Yeah," I say.

"You should sleep," he says. He says it like it's advice, like a thing you can choose.

"Sleep when I'm dead," I say.

He looks at me, expression unreadable in the dim light. "Maybe you should sleep now," he says, and it isn't a joke.

"Maybe," I say, because I don't have a better answer.

We sit in silence for a bit. The cigarette glows. The damp air beads on my skin. Somewhere above us, the shower hisses. The sound carries through the pipes and into the courtyard, faint but insistent. I can feel it in my teeth.

I go back inside because staying out here feels like listening to a warning.

---

By midnight, my body is in that strange space between too tired and too wired. The alcohol keeps me upright. The music keeps me moving. The part of me that is scared is small and quiet and trapped under all the noise.

At one point, I go up to the third floor because I need the bathroom. The hallway is quiet, the emergency light buzzing. The bathroom door is closed now. The hiss is muffled but still there. I look at the door and feel a little flare of anger. The shower should not be running. It should not own this building. It should not be the boss of me.

I open the door.

The room is a steam box. Someone has been showering in the far stall, and the air is thick with heat and soap. The running shower in the broken stall keeps hissing, a constant stream. The floor is wet and shining. The mold patch is slick and dark.

I do not go into the shower. I use the toilet, wash my hands, and keep my eyes on the floor. The flip-flops squeak. The pipe glints. I leave quickly, because I am not stupid. I am just stubborn.

Back downstairs, the music is louder. The shots are flowing. I take another because it's there. I tell myself it's the last one. It never is.

The hours blur. Faces blur. At some point, I find myself on the couch in the chill room with a beer in my hand, the music distant. The room is dim. The ceiling fan spins in lazy circles. My eyelids are heavy. The beer is warm. I close my eyes for a second and the hiss comes back, in my head, in my bones.

I don't know when I make it upstairs. I just know I wake up in my bunk with my clothes half on and my phone buzzing in my pocket. The room is dark. The hiss is still there.

I check the time. 5:12 a.m.

My mouth is dry. My stomach churns. My head is a drum. I close my eyes and promise myself I will sleep. The hiss won't let me. It is in my head like a thought I can't complete.

"Tomorrow morning," I whisper into the pillow. "Shower. Reset. Do it right."

It sounds reasonable in the dark. It sounds like a plan.

The shower hisses, and it sounds like laughter.
