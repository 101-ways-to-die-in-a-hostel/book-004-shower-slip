# Chapter 22: The Almost

The floor moves like it is alive.

One second it is concrete, cold and solid. The next it is a slick sheet of betrayal, a living thing under my right foot. The mold patch is soft as velvet and just as slippery. My heel skates. My body tilts. The running shower hisses behind me like a bad whisper.

I do the drunk windmill, arms wide, fingers clawing at air. The wall is wet. My palm hits it and skates. The knob is in my left hand, and it spins uselessly like a toy. I feel myself go and there is a new sound in the room, a long, slow "oh no" that is definitely not coming from my mouth.

The pipe is right there.

Copper, capped, a little tooth at head height. It seems to grow as I fall, the way bad ideas do. For a split second I see my face in it, warped and pale, and then my body swings past it. I catch the bracket beneath it, a rusted strip of metal, and the edge bites into my hand.

Pain flashes bright and clean. I grunt. My knee kisses the floor. My towel, still around my waist, twists and yanks, almost taking me with it. My shoulder bangs the wall. The pipe hums, a tiny vibration through the metal I am holding, like it is laughing.

I don't hit my head. I don't crack my skull. I don't bleed all over the tiles. I do, however, scrape the skin off my palm and dump a full load of adrenaline into my bloodstream. It feels like a victory and a warning at the same time.

"Whooo," I exhale, half laugh, half gasp. My heart is fast. My ears are ringing. The water keeps running as if nothing happened.

For a second I just stay there, kneeling on the concrete, hand wrapped around the bracket, shoulder to the wet wall, breath short and shallow. The cold bites through my knee. The room smells like mildew and cheap soap and something sour, like old beer in a bottle you forgot to empty.

I look down at my hand. Blood beads up, bright and thin, then runs into the water and disappears. It looks dramatic and pathetic at the same time. I am bleeding into a hostel shower that won't turn off. If this is a metaphor, it's a crappy one.

"You good, mate?" I say to myself. I sound like I'm checking on a stranger.

No one answers. The running shower keeps hissing. The light flickers once, like a slow blink.

I stand, carefully. My legs are shaky, the kind of shaky that feels like my bones are made of foam. The floor is still slick, the t-shirt under my feet now a soaked rag. I take it slow, one step at a time, toes curling for grip. I keep one hand on the wall. My other hand stings.

The knob stares at me, spinning uselessly. I give it one more twist. The water stutters, coughs, then resumes. It is a stubborn problem, which is a perfect match for me.

I could go find Kuba. I could get Marta. I could, for once, do the sensible thing. Instead I grab my towel and press it into my bleeding palm. The towel darkens immediately.

"That's my clean," I mutter.

The towel is not clean anymore. Neither am I. The shower has taken that away. I step out of the stall, heart still ticking too fast. I leave the broken shower running. I leave the mop in the corner. I leave the floor wet and the problem unsolved. It feels like a tiny betrayal, but not nearly big enough to stop me.

The hallway air is colder, and the emergency light makes everything look sickly. My feet are wet. My towel is wet. My pride is wet. The hallway smells faintly like cigarettes and wet socks. It is, in other words, home.

I reach my bunk and sit on the edge. My bed is damp where the leak had been, but it has mostly dried. There is a faint watermark on the ceiling above it, a tea-colored bruise. I press my towel harder against my palm and watch the blood soak through.

My phone buzzes. A text from Mum. I flip it over. I don't open it. I am not the kind of bloke who answers texts with his hand bleeding and his towel ruined. I am the kind of bloke who wipes his hand on his shorts and goes to the bar.

I stand and look toward the bathroom door. The water sound is faint in the hallway, a constant hiss. It feels like it's calling me back, like a dare. I look away.

"Later," I say, and walk downstairs.

---

The bar is in recovery mode, which in this place means it smells like toast and beer and sweat and not quite enough cleaning spray. The lights are low. The music is soft, a lazy beat that could be a heartbeat if you closed your eyes. People are sprawled on couches, heads in hands, hair wild, like a battlefield of bad decisions.

Kuba spots me the moment I come in. He points at my towel. "You mop the floor with your face?"

"Almost," I say. I hold up my hand, the palm wrapped in damp towel. "Look what the shower did to me. It's out for blood."

He hops down from behind the bar and takes a look. "That's nothing. Here." He grabs a roll of tape and a wad of paper towel from under the counter. He wraps my hand in a quick, lazy bandage. The tape sticks to my skin. It's not medical, but it's something.

"You should get that cleaned," he says.

"I just did," I say. "In the dirtiest place in the building. I'm fully vaccinated now." I lift the taped hand and wiggle my fingers. The pain pulses, not terrible, just sharp enough to remind me.

He shakes his head. "You in the bathroom again?"

"Had to," I say. "Shower was still running. Floor was a lake. I sorted it." I say sorted like it means fixed. It doesn't.

Kuba snorts. "You're not maintenance, Brad. You are a hazard." He tosses a glass of water at me. I catch it with my good hand.

"Hazard is my brand," I say, and drink. The water is cold and clean. It hurts my stomach. I chase it with a beer, because my stomach is more used to that.

Mae slides onto a stool beside me, a mug of instant coffee in her hands. Her eyes are soft, tired. She smells like soap again, which feels like a personal insult.

"What happened to your hand?" she asks.

"Shower tried to take me out," I say. I keep it light. I keep it funny.

"You slipped?"

"Nearly. I caught myself." I twist my wrist, flexing, to show off the bandage. "Reflexes of a cat. A drunk cat."

Mae doesn't laugh. She looks up at me, over the rim of her mug. "That's not funny."

"It is if you tell it right." I spin the story, because that's what I do. I say the floor moved, I say the pipe was hungry, I say I made it out with nothing but a sexy bandage. I add a dramatic moment where I saved a helpless towel from the flood. I perform it for the bar. Kuba cracks a smile. A guy on the couch cheers. Someone yells, "Legend!"

I soak it in. The praise tastes like beer and relief. It feels like proof that I am still alive, still entertaining, still me. The adrenaline fades, leaving a hollow behind it. I fill it with another beer.

"You should stop going in there," Liv says from a couch. She has her legs tucked up and her hoodie pulled tight. She looks like she hasn't slept.

"It's my bathroom, mate," I say. "I'm claiming it." I lift my bandaged hand in a mock salute.

She rolls her eyes. "One of these days, that place is going to get you." She says it like a joke. Her eyes don't match.

"One of these days I'll die in a shower," I say. "At least I'll be clean."

The words hang there. The room goes quiet for a half beat, like the music skipped. Then someone laughs. I laugh too, because I know the only way out of that sentence is through.

"Don't be a headline," Mae says, softer this time.

"If I'm a headline, it'll be a good one," I say. "Brad the Lad conquers death, still makes it to pre-game."

She shakes her head and sips her coffee. I can feel her worry like a hand on the back of my neck. I shrug it off and reach for the beer. The beer is easier to handle.

My phone buzzes again. Another text. I flip it over again. I don't need to read it to know who it is. My mum's worry lives in my pocket like a small, persistent animal. I keep it there. I keep it quiet.

"You going to the crawl tonight?" Kuba asks.

"Course," I say. "It's Prague. It's the law."

"You're bleeding."

"I'm always bleeding. It's a lifestyle." I lift my taped hand and it thumps lightly against the bar. The tape pulls. The wound throbs. I ignore it.

There is a poster on the wall behind Kuba, taped up with cheap neon tape. It shows a cartoon skull in a shower cap, and the words SHOWER SOBER. DON'T BE A HEADLINE. Someone has added a moustache to the skull. It makes the warning look like a joke, which is probably the point.

I stare at it longer than I mean to. The skull's eyes are hollow. It grins like it knows something. I look away.

"Shot?" Kuba asks.

"Always," I say.

The liquor burns and the edges of the morning blur. The near-fall becomes a story, and stories are safe. They are not the same as fear. They are something you can tell while the beer pong balls bounce and the music thumps.

The day slides into afternoon. The bar fills. The air warms. The smell of toast fades, replaced by sweat and beer and whatever someone is cooking in the kitchen that will be abandoned halfway through. The hostel hums with that familiar, low-key chaos. It is comforting and vile at the same time.

I go upstairs to rinse my hand because the bandage is sticking to the cut and I can feel the tape pulling skin every time I move. The stairwell is damp and smells like cigarettes and old mop water. The third-floor hallway is quiet, but the bathroom is not. The hiss of running water is still there, unbothered.\n\nI push the door with my shoulder and slip inside. The floor shines under the flickering light, a wet mirror with grime under the surface. Someone has tried to mop again. The mop is in the corner, its head dark and heavy. The broken shower is still running, water hitting the wall in a constant stream, making a small river across the concrete toward the drain.\n\nI step around it, careful. My feet whisper over the slick surface. I don't step on the mold patch. I don't look at the pipe. I go straight to the sinks, the row of three porcelain basins that look like they survived a war. Only one of them works. The other two are clogged and full of hair and cigarette ash.\n\nThe working sink coughs when I turn it on. The water is cold and weak. I rinse my hand anyway, letting the water sting the cut. Blood loosens, threads down the drain in thin lines. It swirls with the soap scum and disappears.\n\nI look up at the mirror. It is cracked at the edges and smeared with fingerprints. My face is there, puffy-eyed, skin flushed from beer and heat. My hair sticks up in bleached tufts. There is a red scrape on my shoulder from the wall. I lift it, turn it toward the light. It looks like a bad sunburn, a raw stripe. The mirror makes it look worse.\n\n\"This is what legends look like,\" I say to my reflection. I sound like a liar.\n\nThe bathroom door opens behind me. I flinch, then relax when I see the guy. German, tall, the kind of bloke who actually uses shower flip-flops. He wears them now, black rubber with thin straps. He has a towel around his neck and a toiletry bag in his hand. He nods.\n\n\"Morgen,\" he says.\n\n\"Morning,\" I say. My voice echoes.\n\nHe takes a look at the running shower and the wet floor. \"It never stops?\"\n\n\"Broken knob,\" I say. \"It's got a mind of its own.\"\n\nHe steps carefully, keeping his flip-flops on the concrete and his toes far from the mold. He sees my bandaged hand. \"You fell?\"\n\n\"Nearly,\" I say. \"Caught myself on the wall.\"\n\nHe makes a face that says that was not lucky, just close. \"That pipe is bad,\" he says. His English is good but the word bad comes out like bahd. \"A guy hit it yesterday, yes?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" I say. \"Ambulance at dawn.\"\n\nHe nods slowly. \"I use the second floor usually. Here is...\" He searches for the word. \"Crazy.\"\n\n\"It's all crazy,\" I say. \"That is the brand.\"\n\nHe smiles politely. He looks past me at the pipe, then down at his flip-flops. \"I keep these always. In some hostels, they steal your shoes. Here, maybe they save your head.\"\n\n\"Mine didn't save my ego,\" I say, and he gives a small laugh.\n\nI wash my hand one more time, then pat it dry with a strip of paper towel. It disintegrates. I wrap the tape back around and hold it in place. The cut throbs, steady and small. I look at the water running from the broken shower. The sound is a hiss, constant and soft, like a snake in the wall.\n\n\"You should tell them,\" he says, pointing at the knob.\n\n\"I did. Kuba knows. Filip knows. Marta knows. The shower knows.\" I gesture at the running stream. \"It doesn't care.\"\n\nHe shrugs. \"Then don't use it.\"\n\n\"Wish it was that easy,\" I say, and he gives me the look again, the one that says you make it hard. He is not wrong.\n\nHe steps into the far stall and turns on his shower. The water hits the wall with a metallic ping. Two showers now, two streams, two slick patches on a floor that already feels like ice. The room grows warmer, thicker. The mirror fogs at the corners.\n\nI watch him for a second, then look away. The pipe glints. The flickering light makes it look like it's moving, like it's leaning. I feel a shiver that isn't from the cold.\n\n\"Stay upright,\" I tell myself. It is a small prayer.\n\nI step out, careful. The hallway seems brighter after the bathroom's wet gloom. I hear the showers running behind me, their hiss in stereo. I walk back down the stairs, the bandage on my palm still damp, and try to convince myself I am responsible now.\n+
At some point, I stand and feel a wave of dizziness. It catches me by surprise. I grip the bar, the wood tacky under my fingers. The room tilts. It rights itself. Nobody notices. I smile anyway, because that's the easiest mask to wear.

I take another beer and drift toward the courtyard for air. The tarp is still stretched over the chairs, a sad tent. The puddles reflect the fairy lights. I sit and let the cold hit my face.

A Polish guy sits across from me, cigarette in hand. He doesn't say anything for a while. We just watch the smoke curl in the damp air.

"Bathroom still broken?" he asks finally.

"Yeah," I say.

He nods. "This place is cheap for a reason."

"But it's got vibes," I say. I gesture to the wet chairs, the flickering lights, the distant bass. He laughs, which feels like approval.

My phone buzzes again. I ignore it. The cigarettes smell like my dad's old jacket. I don't like it. I stand and go back inside.

---

The night comes in without asking.

By ten, the bar is loud enough that you feel it in your teeth. The lights have gone from warm to strobe. The crowd has doubled. The recovery crawl is a memory, replaced by a new round of bad ideas. I am in the middle of it, of course, because where else would I be.

I play drinking games. I lose. I win. I forget which. I dance with a girl from Manchester who says she loves Australia and has never been. I tell her she should come, and she says she will, and I know she won't. We spin under the lights like we're not all going to be old someday.

Somewhere in the middle of the chaos, I feel the bandage on my hand peel loose. Blood seeps through again, a small red stain on the tape. It looks like a warning. I wrap it tighter with a napkin and keep going.

"You're leaking," Liv says when she sees it.

"So is the shower," I say.

"You're a mess," she says.

"You're here too," I say, and she laughs despite herself.

Kuba hands me another beer. He looks like he's had about six hours of sleep in the past week. He is running on caffeine and adrenaline and the kind of responsibility that looks like apathy. He shouts in my ear, "You still alive?"

"Barely," I shout back. We laugh because that's what you do when the music is too loud and the warning signs are everywhere.

The door to the hallway is open. I catch a glimpse of the stairs, dark and damp. The smell from the bathroom drifts down in a wave of mildew. It is the smell of wet concrete and old soap and something stale. It cuts through the beer stink like a blade.

"God, this place," Mae says beside me. She wipes sweat off her forehead with the back of her wrist. The music hits and she flinches. "I need air."

"Let's go," I say, and we push out into the courtyard again.

It is colder outside. The air is damp and clean compared to inside. The fairy lights hum. The tarp flaps slightly in the wind. We sit on the same wet chairs. My shorts soak up the damp. I don't care.

"You should answer them," Mae says, nodding toward my pocket.

"What?"

"Your phone. It's buzzing every ten minutes."

I pull it out. Three missed calls. Two texts. All from Mum. My chest tightens. I click one without thinking. It says: Call me, I'm worried. It's simple. It feels like a punch.

"She worries," I say.

"She's your mum," Mae says. "That's her job."

"Mine is to worry her," I say, smiling. It doesn't feel like a smile.

She doesn't laugh. She looks at me, really looks. In the cold light, her eyes are clear and tired. "You can stop playing the legend for five minutes, you know," she says. "You can just be Brad."

The words land. They feel dangerous. I pick at the tape on my hand. I look at the wet concrete under my feet. I think about the pipe. I think about the slip. I think about the shower running and the floor sliding and the moment my skull almost met copper.

"Brad is boring," I say.

"Brad is alive," she says.

We sit in the damp silence for a beat. The bass from inside thumps like a distant heartbeat. Somewhere above us, a shower runs. The sound is faint but constant. I can hear it in the pipes.

"I'll call her tomorrow," I say.

Mae nods. She knows tomorrow is a lie but she lets it stand. We go back inside. The warmth hits like a slap. The music swallows the quiet.

Someone has opened the basement door and the sound from the cave rises up like a growl. I let myself get pulled down there for a bit, because saying no would require more spine than I have. The basement is a low-ceilinged room with brick walls sweating in the heat. The air is wet and hot and smells like spilled vodka. The lights are red. It feels like a throat.

We dance in a crush of bodies, elbows and shoulders and the occasional flying beer. My bandage comes loose again and I can feel the sting of air on the cut. I wrap it tighter with the hem of my shirt, then with a wristband someone throws at me. The whole thing looks ridiculous. It fits.

A guy in a bucket hat shouts, \"Bathroom still a death trap?\" like it's a joke. I shout back, \"Only if you're sober,\" and he laughs so hard he almost drops his drink. The joke tastes sour. The bass thumps in my chest like a second heartbeat. For a minute I forget about the pipe. For a minute I am just a body in a room full of bodies, moving in time, not thinking.

Then someone shoves past and my shoulder bangs the wall, the same shoulder that hit the tile. Pain flashes. I suck air through my teeth. I ride it out. The night doesn't pause for anyone.

---

By two in the morning, my body feels like a half-charged phone. It is buzzing but close to dead. My head aches. My mouth is dry. My skin is sticky. The last beer tastes like metal.

I stumble up the stairs with a few others, a small caravan of the almost-sober. The hallway is quiet, lit by the green emergency light that makes everything look like it belongs underwater. The bathroom door is open. The hiss of running water is still there.

It's been running all day.

The sound is a mosquito in my head. It is the drip on my face, the flood on the floor, the slip under my foot. It is the problem I tried to fix and didn't. It is still there, still hissing, still waiting.

I pause in the doorway without meaning to. The floor glistens. The mold patch is darker now, fed by a day's worth of water. The pipe gleams. The light flickers. The broken shower sprays at the wall like it is trying to erode it, grain by grain. The drain gurgles, swallowing what it can.

"Sort it tomorrow," I whisper. It is the same lie, worn thin.

I make it to my bunk. I climb in, towelless, still damp. The sheets are rough and smell like old sweat. I lie down and stare at the ceiling. The tea-stain above my bed looks like a map of somewhere I can't place.

The hiss of the shower is faint but constant. It threads through the dorm like a bad dream. I close my eyes and it gets louder. I can almost feel the water on my skin again, the floor sliding, the pipe looming.

I roll over, press my face into the pillow. The pillow smells like someone else's shampoo and a little bit of vomit. It is not comforting. The hiss persists.

"Sleep when I'm dead," I mumble. It sounds tired, not triumphant.

My phone buzzes one more time. I ignore it. The screen glows in the dark like a tiny, judgmental eye. I turn it face down.

My hand throbs. My shoulder aches. My head spins. My body is heavy. The hostel hums around me, a living, breathing beast of cheap beer and bad choices.

Somewhere down the hall, a door slams. Someone laughs. Someone coughs. The shower keeps running.

I think about the morning. I think about the idea of a shower washing this day off, resetting me, making me feel human again. I think about the floor, the mold, the pipe. I think about the text I did not answer.

"Tomorrow," I whisper into the dark. "I'll be careful tomorrow."

The water answers in a steady hiss. It doesn't believe me.
