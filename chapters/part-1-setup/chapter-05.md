# Chapter 05: Rubber Saints

The shower took the first step for me.

I pushed through the door and the heat hit my face, a wet hand of steam and mildew and cheap soap. The light flickered once, then steadied in that nervous way fluorescent lights do, like they're trying not to blink. The floor gleamed. The stalls were half-open mouths. I could see the second stall, the concrete, the missing tiles, the pipe jutting out like a knuckle. It looked smaller from the hallway, more abstract. Up close, it was a hard, real thing. It had sharp edges. It had rust.

I put my flip-flops on at the sink and they felt like a blessing, rubber between me and whatever this floor wanted. They were the kind with a little ridge pattern, cheap and thin. The straps cut into my big toe. The rubber smell mixed with the dampness of the room. I told myself this was me being sensible, as if that could rewire the night before.

I picked the middle stall because I always do. The curtain stuck to my fingers when I pulled it closed, the plastic clammy and cold. I hung my towel on the hook, tested it with a tug. It wobbled. The hook looked like it had been bent by someone heavier than a towel. The drain was a dark circle in the concrete, a mouth with teeth.

The water took its time. It coughed air, spat rusty for a second, then cleared. The pressure came on like a surprise punch. It was cold enough to make my teeth ache, then hot enough to make me hiss. I stepped back, then forward, a little dance of self-preservation. My head throbbed, but the water was loud enough to drown out the worst of it. It hit my shoulders and felt like it was trying to wash out a week, not just a night.

The floor was not my friend. Even with the flip-flops, I could feel the slickness underneath, the concrete polished by a thousand wet feet. The rubber slid a fraction of an inch. It was tiny, but my body clocked it, a pulse of adrenaline in my chest. I spread my feet wider and told myself to be careful. The shower did not care.

I tried to take stock of my body the way a mechanic listens to an engine. My head was loud. My stomach was empty and angry. My hands shook when I closed them into fists, a small tremor I could blame on coffee if I wanted. There were bruises I could feel without looking. The floor was too cold. The water was too hot. The bathroom smelled like bleach and wet concrete and something faintly sweet, like old soap melting into the drain.

I reached for the soap on the little built-in ledge. My hand came back with a bar someone else had used, a hotel-size rectangle gone soft and translucent. The water hit it and it melted further, turning my palm slick. I washed my face and felt the booze and sweat run down my cheeks, bitter in the corners of my mouth. I spit into the drain and watched it swirl, an edible piece of last night disappearing.

The pipe in the second stall was in my line of sight, just over the curtain edge, a copper finger poking into the room. I could see the rust halo around it. I could see where the tiles had been, the concrete underneath rough and darker from damp. The pipe was not in my stall, but it felt like it was, like this whole bathroom shared the same nervous system.

I closed my eyes and let the water pound my scalp. The heat was a relief, then a sting. It smelled like mildew and the faint metallic tang of copper. I could taste the last shot in my throat, anise and regret. The shower roared, and for a moment I could pretend I wasn't in a hostel bathroom that looked like a crime scene before the crime.

My flip-flop skidded.

It was nothing. It was a tiny slip, a fraction of a second. But my body went into alarm, arms flung out, fingers reaching for something that wasn't there. My right hand hit the wall and slid on the slick concrete, found a rusted bracket and gripped it. The bracket bit into my palm. I caught myself before the fall, heart thudding like it had just been promised something.

There was a sign above the sinks that said PLEASE USE SHOWER MATS in blocky black letters. Someone had drawn a smiley face next to it, the kind with Xs for eyes. I could see it through the curtain seam as I steadied myself. It felt like a joke that wasn't sure who it was laughing at. I pictured the stack of mats in the corner, damp and heavy, and I pictured myself slipping without them. The picture was too vivid, so I shook my head and made it a laugh.

"Whoaaa," I said to no one, and laughed because I didn't fall.

The sound echoed. The shower was too loud, the room too small. The laugh felt too big for my mouth. I stood there, breathing, one hand on the wall, water running over my back. I could feel the drain pulling at the water under my feet. I could feel my pulse in my temples.

This is what I do. I almost fall, I laugh, I make it a story. I tell myself it doesn't count.

I turned the water cooler and finished quick. I rinsed off the soap, scrubbed the night out of my hair, and shut the tap with a jerk. The silence hit me like a second impact. Without the water, the room sounded empty and wet. Drips fell from my hair. The floor held its shine.

I stepped out carefully, one flip-flop at a time, gripping the wall. The towel was rough against my skin, damp from the hook. I wrapped it around my waist and looked at myself in the mirror above the sink. My eyes were red, but they always were. My hair was plastered down, the bleach tips darkened by water. There was a red mark on my palm where the bracket had pressed. I flexed my hand and the skin pulled.

On the wall near the second stall, a smear of dried brown streaked the grout. It could have been rust. It could have been old blood. In this light, everything looked guilty. I stared at it for a second, then shrugged it off. Someone probably had a nosebleed. Someone probably got too drunk. Someone probably laughed it off just like me.

I walked out of the bathroom into the hallway and the air felt cool, merciful. The mop bucket was still under the stairs, catching a drip. The caution sign leaned against the wall like it had given up. I toweled my hair and told myself the shower was fine, the flip-flops did their job, the day could start.

My phone buzzed. A message from my sister, a string of question marks. I slid it into my pocket without opening it.

---

By noon, the bar was alive again, a wet animal shaking itself awake.

Kuba had the recovery beers lined up like a ritual, foam spilling over the sides. The first sip was the opposite of the shower. It did not clean. It soothed. It sanded down the edges of my headache and gave my tongue something familiar. The bar smelled like stale beer, citrus cleaner, and the ghost of cigarettes. The bass from last night still lived in the walls, a low thump that never quite left.

"You live," Kuba said, handing me a beer like it was medicine.

"Nearly died in the shower," I said.

He laughed. "Then you are on brand." He clinked my cup with his and turned to serve someone else. The bar never closes. The jokes never change. That is the deal.

A group of new arrivals clustered by the Polaroid wall, faces still clean and bright. I drifted toward them like gravity. Being the guy who knows this place means something to me. It makes me feel like I belong, like I didn't just accidentally end up here with a one-way ticket and a borrowed personality.

"Welcome to Mad House," I said, spreading my arms wide. "If you're looking for sleep, turn around now. If you're looking for a legendary time, you're in the right spot." I made it sound like a promise. They laughed. They were young enough to believe it.

A tall bloke with a Canadian flag on his backpack asked about the bathrooms. "They're a bit dodgy," I said. "Wear flip-flops. Mind the pipe. You'll be sweet." It felt good to be the one with answers, even if the answers were dumb.

Marta pushed her mop through the common room, leaving a wet trail that caught the light. She glared at a puddle, then at me. "You tell them to wear shoes?" she asked.

"Every time," I said.

She snorted. "They don't listen." She jabbed the mop toward the corridor, as if scolding the floor itself. "Floor is hungry. It likes tourists." She said it flat, no joke, and I laughed anyway because I did not know what else to do.

The afternoon slid into the kind of chaos that feels like a holiday commercial. Beer pong started at the table by the window. Someone put on a playlist that called itself Bangers Vol. 4. The sun was weak, filtered through clouds, but the room warmed with bodies and noise. I played three rounds and won two. Every time the ball dropped into a cup, a small cheer went up like a church response. I liked that sound. I liked being the reason for it.

We drank. We shouted. We kept score in a way that did not matter. The beer tasted cold and bitter, the kind that tricks you into thinking you are hydrating. The dog in the courtyard wandered in and sat under the table, nose twitching. I dropped it a chip. It stared at me, then ate it like a pity.

I filmed a short video of the table, the cups lined like a battlefield, my own laugh louder than the music. The video made me look steadier than I felt. My hands still trembled when I lifted my cup. I told myself it was the caffeine, not the booze. I told myself lots of things. The comments came in quick, the little hearts and fire emojis, and I felt the warm glow of being seen without being known. It was the kind of attention that feeds you but never fills you.

The hostel served a family dinner at two, a pot of goulash that smelled like paprika and something burned. I took a bowl because it looked responsible. I ate half of it, then pushed the rest around with my spoon, waiting for my stomach to agree. It didn't. The stew sat heavy in my gut like a promise. I drank water to wash it down and it came back up with a sour belch. I laughed and called it a cleanse. A girl with a nose ring said, \"Mood,\" and we clinked our cups.

In the kitchen, someone had written on the whiteboard: DRINK WATER OR DIE. It was in the same neat caps as the bathroom signs, as if the building itself had a voice. I snapped a photo of it, thought about posting it, then didn't. It felt like tempting the wrong kind of attention.

Around three, the rain started again. It hit the courtyard tiles and the sound carried into the bar like a second beat. The drain in the courtyard clogged, water pooling, a shallow mirror for neon light. Someone filmed it for a story. "Prague apocalypse," they said, laughing. Marta muttered in Czech and shoved a broom at the water. The broom did not care.

I went upstairs to grab my charger and nearly skated on the hallway tile. The puddle by the stairs had spread. I caught myself on the banister and laughed, because if I didn't laugh it would feel like a warning. The banister was slick, paint peeling in my palm. The mop bucket was still there, still catching the drip. The drip made a soft, patient sound, like a clock.

In the hallway, the air was damp. The bathroom door was open. I could hear the shower running. Somebody singing off-key. I slowed as I passed. The sound of water hitting concrete made my skin want to crawl, like a memory you can't place. I kept walking anyway.

In the dorm, my bed was a mess of towel and shorts. I grabbed my charger from the floor and checked my phone. Another text from Mum: "Call when you can." The screen dimmed before I could answer. I slid it back into my pocket and told myself I would call later, when I had time, when I wasn't in the middle of something. I was always in the middle of something.

Back downstairs, the afternoon had thickened. The music grew louder. The room smelled like sweat and citrus and beer. Someone shoved a shot into my hand and I took it without thinking. It burned like a dare. My head cleared for a second, then fuzzed again. The recovery beers were no longer recovery. They were just more.

A guy named Felix challenged me to a chug. He had a mustache drawn on his face and a Hawaiian shirt that said LAST CHANCE. We raced. I won. He high-fived me like I had done something noble. The room cheered. I felt the old familiar rush: the tiny thrill of being seen as the legend I keep promising to be.

By early evening, the hostel had that pre-party buzz, the kind where everyone's energy starts to tilt toward night. The bar crew set up a drinking game called Rage King. The rules were complicated and didn't matter. The rule was to drink. I held court at the table, yelling instructions, laughing at people who didn't know the song. My laugh got louder with every round. It always does. It is part of the costume.

At some point, a guy from Brno sat next to me, Czech, local. He spoke English like he learned it from British TV. He told me about a hostel in his city where a tourist fell off a balcony trying to take a selfie. He laughed at the punchline, but his eyes didn't. "You people are crazy," he said, not unkind.

"We are legends," I said, raising my cup.

He nodded toward the stairs. "That bathroom though. Crazy too. Pipe in there, you know?" He made a gesture like a head hit. "Very bad. You should be careful. My cousin worked here. He said people slip." He said it like a fact, not a warning. I took it as a challenge.

"Cheers for the concern," I said, and clinked my cup against his. "I've survived worse than a pipe."

He looked at me like he wanted to say more, then let it go. The music swallowed the moment. I felt invincible because I always do when the room is cheering.

We did a shot of something green that tasted like eucalyptus and paint. It made my eyes water. I thought about the shower, about how that smell was the same as the soap, how everything in this place was designed to clean you and keep you dirty at the same time. I told myself I would take it easy tonight. I said that out loud. Felix laughed and handed me another drink.

I posted a story of the beer pong table, the cups lined like ammunition. I captioned it RECOVERY BEERS TURNED WAR. The filter made the lights look pink. The comments came quick: LEGEND, KING, KEEP GOING. I smiled at the screen like it was a mirror.

When the sun dropped, the rain stopped, leaving the city damp and shining. The courtyard smelled like wet concrete and cigarette smoke. The fountain gurgled, clogged again with leaves. Someone lit a cigarette by the doorway and the smoke curled into the bar like another ghost. I told myself I'd call Mum after dinner, after pre-game, after the first bar. I told myself a lot of things.

We left for the club at ten, a noisy herd spilling into the cold. The street was slick and the air was sharp. The city glowed in that way Prague does, gold on stone, the kind of beauty that makes you forget you are standing in a puddle. The club swallowed us whole. The music was a heartbeat you could dance to. The shots were lined up like a dare. I did not say no.

---

I came back alone.

It was after three, the club disgorging us in pieces. People peeled off to kebab shops, to afters, to beds. I walked back to the hostel because it felt like home, which is a stupid thing to say about a place that charges you by the night. The streets were quiet and wet. My shoes left dark prints on the cobblestones. I passed a statue I had never really looked at and promised myself I would be cultured tomorrow.

The hostel was still awake, but quieter, the neon sign buzzing in a lower key. The bar had a few stragglers, heads on arms, empty cups like empty eyes. Kuba lifted his hand in a lazy salute. I lifted mine back. We did not need words. The dog was asleep on the couch, chest rising and falling, a small anchor in a sea of chaos.

Upstairs, the hallway smelled like wet towels and the ghost of bleach. The mop bucket was still there, faithful. The drip continued. Drip. Drip. The water was patient. The floor gleamed, slick in the emergency light. I stepped around the puddle, careful without admitting it to myself.

In the dorm, everyone was asleep or passed out. The air was thick with sweat and the sour edge of vomit. Someone had left the window open a crack and the cold cut through the room, the kind that makes your bones ache. I stripped down to my shorts and climbed onto my bunk, the plastic mattress protector sticking to my skin like tape. I lay there and stared at the underside of the top bunk, the slats a zebra pattern in the dim light.

My phone buzzed. I pulled it out, squinting. A missed call from my sister. A text from Mum: "Please just let me know you're okay." The words hit harder than any hangover. I stared at them until they blurred. I typed "I'm fine" three times and deleted it three times. I felt small in the blue light, like a kid hiding under a blanket with a torch.

I thought about calling. It felt like the edge of a cliff. If I called, I would have to sound normal. I would have to explain why I never call. I would have to explain who I am here, who I have become. I didn't know how to say any of that. I put the phone face down.

The fear came in quiet, the way it always does when the music stops. It was not a big fear. It was the soft one, the one that sits in your chest and hums. What if this is all I am? What if I am the guy who drinks and laughs and posts and never answers his mum? What if the party ends and I have nothing to say?

I rolled onto my side and found the towel on the rail by my bed. It was damp from the shower earlier. It smelled like mildew and cheap soap. I pulled it over my face, muffling my breath. The room was too loud and too quiet at the same time. Someone snored. Someone muttered in their sleep. The pipes knocked, a small metallic sound that kept time.

My eyes burned. I let them. I didn't sob. I couldn't. The tears came anyway, small and stupid, soaking into the towel. I pressed the fabric to my face and tried to make it silent. I didn't want anyone to wake up and see Brad the Lad crying into his own towel like a kid.

I thought about Mum's kitchen wall, the photo of me in my apprentice uniform, clean and hopeful. I thought about the day I quit, the way my boss looked at me like he was disappointed and relieved at the same time. I thought about my sister, the way she used to steal my beers and laugh, how she cried the last time we talked. I thought about the girl in Barcelona who told me I was funny and then asked if I was okay, and how I answered with a joke. I am very good at jokes.

The tears stopped. I wiped my face and sat up, heart pounding like I had done something illegal. The room was still asleep. The world outside the window was a soft, wet dark. The hostel groaned in its old bones.

I grabbed my phone again and opened my sister's missed call. My thumb hovered over the call button, shaking. I almost pressed it. I didn't. I sent her a text instead: "Sorry, was out. Call tomorrow. Love you." It was a lie and a promise at the same time.

I lay back and stared at the ceiling. The hum of the hostel was a low choir: pipes ticking, a door thudding shut somewhere, a distant laugh that might have been the bar or might have been in my head. The sound of water in the walls made me think of the Gold Coast, the way waves hit the sand and then retreat, leaving the beach slick and shining. I remembered building sandcastles with my sister when we were kids, the way the water would creep up and take them apart, grain by grain. We'd build them anyway. We'd laugh when they fell. The memory felt too soft for this room, too clean.

I pictured my mum calling me in for dinner, her voice through the screen door, the sound of cicadas in the yard. I could smell the heat of home, the sunscreen, the cheap sausages on the barbecue. I had not thought about that smell in a while. I let it sit in my head for a second, then it faded under the damp air and the sour edge of vomit.

I put the phone down and lay back. The towel was damp against my neck. My head throbbed in time with the drip. The shower felt far away now, a thing I had done and could pretend fixed me. The truth was in the room, in my chest, in the way the floor still tilted when I closed my eyes.

At some point, the water started running again in the bathroom down the hall, a steady rush that cut through the night like a river. I listened to it for a long time. The pipes shuddered. The sound filled the walls. I thought about the concrete floor, the pipe, the slickness. I thought about how cold that water would feel on my face tomorrow morning when the hangover came back. I thought about how easy it would be to stand under it, to let it rinse everything, to let it make me feel clean again.

"Hair of the dog will sort this out," I whispered, the words tasting like metal.

The water kept running. The drip kept time. The hostel held its breath. I closed my eyes and let the sound of the shower lull me, like rain on a tin roof, like a warning I didn't want to hear.

Somewhere in the hall, a door clicked. A foot scuffed. Then quiet again. I told myself it was nothing. I told myself tomorrow would be cleaner, lighter, the same promise in a new bottle. The darkness pressed in. The pipes kept talking.
