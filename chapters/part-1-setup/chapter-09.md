# Chapter 09: The Thin Line

There is a thin line between a joke and a warning, and this place paints it on the floor in water.

I see it the moment I step into the hallway: a glistening ribbon of wet tile, a silver vein running from the bathroom door to the stairs. It catches the flicker of the emergency light like a wink. I know that line. I have stepped over it, around it, through it. I have laughed at it. I have forgotten it the second I was past it. This morning it looks like it is waiting for me.

My head feels like someone is stirring it with a spoon. My tongue is a dry rag. The air in the dorm has the consistency of soup: sweat, beer, cheap detergent, and that faint, sweet sour that means someone missed the bucket by a hair. The bucket is full again, a dark offering in the corner. The wall above it says AIM FOR THE BUCKET. I aim for anything else.

I swing my legs down, find my thongs with my toes, and stand up slowly. The world tips, then steadies. I pass the mirror and catch my own reflection in the dark glass of a locker: red eyes, blonde tips gone greenish from chlorine and smoke, a face that looks older than twenty-two in hostel light. I am not ready to see that, so I keep walking.

In the hallway, the wet floor sign has been propped up again, the same yellow triangle like a bored bouncer. It warns about what everyone already knows. The mop bucket under the stairs is still there, still catching the drip from the ceiling. Plink. Plink. Plink. It is the only reliable metronome in my life.

Marta is already on the floor, rag in hand, scrubbing the same patch of tile like she is trying to erase a memory. She does not look up when I pass. She does not have to. She knows my footsteps.

"You alive," she says anyway.

"Barely," I say, because that is my morning prayer.

She lifts her chin toward the bathroom, a tiny motion. "Not now. Floor full. Drain slow." Her Czech accent makes slow sound like a knife.

"I just need a rinse," I say, though I am not sure who I am convincing.

"You need sleep," she says, and keeps scrubbing. "Water not fix everything." She says it like a fact, not a lesson.

I want to laugh, to make it lighter, to toss a joke back so I can pretend the moment was just banter. The joke sticks in my throat. I step around the wet line and push the bathroom door open.

The air inside is warm and wet, a hand on my face. The light flickers, then holds, like it is deciding whether to participate. The floor is slick, a sheen over concrete and tile. The drains gurgle without conviction. A bar of soap sits on the ledge, a soft translucent rectangle gone thin from too many strangers. The mirror above the sinks is fogged, making every face in it look like a ghost.

The second stall is open. It always is. The concrete floor in there is darker than the rest, the color of wet asphalt. The pipe is there, the copper finger at head height, its cap dulled by rust. Someone has drawn a smiley face on the wall beside it, but the eyes are Xs. The joke is as thin as the line on the floor.

I step to the sink and run the tap. It sputters, coughs, then delivers water cold enough to sting. It smells metallic. I cup it and splash my face. The cold shock is a slap that clears nothing. I lift my head and stare at myself in the mirror, a double image in the fog. For a second I see myself twice, one version with my eyes open, the other with them closed, and I think about the difference between those two states. I think about sleep. I think about the way I keep saying sleep when I am dead.

In the stall, the water drips from a shower head someone forgot to shut off. Drip. Drip. Drip. The sound is small and soft, the opposite of the roar that used to fill these rooms. It makes the air feel like it is waiting for something.

I should leave. I should listen to Marta. I should not trust a wet floor and a head full of absinthe. But I am here, and the water is right there, and the ritual is part of what keeps me upright. I tell myself I will only rinse. Two minutes. No soap. No dancing. I can do two minutes.

I step toward the middle stall and slide the curtain closed. It sticks to my forearm like a wet hand. I hang my towel on the hook and test it with a tug. It wobbles but holds. I take a breath and twist the faucet.

The water comes out cold, then warmer, then hot enough to make me hiss. It smells like the pipes and mildew and something else, a faint sweetness that might be the soap or might be the mold. I stand under it and let it run over my face and down my neck. It is relief and punishment at the same time.

The floor under my feet is slick even through the rubber. I feel it give, a tiny slide, and I widen my stance. My hands go to the wall without thinking. The wall is wet and smooth, no texture, no grip. I find the edge of the curtain rod instead, my fingers closing around it as if it could hold me. The rod feels loose. I let go and tell myself to stay still.

For a second I imagine the pipe in the other stall, the way it sticks out like a knuckle, the way my head would find it if I slipped at the wrong angle. The thought is too clear, so I turn my face into the water and let it erase the image.

Two minutes. I count in my head, slow and steady. The water runs. The drain gurgles. I feel the hangover pull back an inch. I feel the panic in my chest loosen a fraction. I tell myself it is working. I tell myself I am clean. I tell myself a lot of things.

When I turn the water off, the silence is loud. It makes the bathroom feel hollow. I step out carefully, towel around my waist, and check the floor for the thin line of water that should not be there. It is there anyway. It always is.

I leave the bathroom and the hallway feels cold in comparison. Marta is still mopping. She glances at my damp hair and makes a sound that might be a sigh.

"You're stubborn," she says.

"You're a saint," I say.

"I'm tired," she says, and goes back to scrubbing.

Downstairs, the bar is in its quiet hour. The neon sign hums, a low buzz like a bee trapped in a jar. Kuba is wiping the counter with a rag that has been through too much. He looks up when I come in, takes one look at my wet hair, and laughs.

"You showered," he says, like he is surprised I pulled it off.

"I'm full of surprises," I say.

He slides a glass of water toward me and a coffee that smells like burnt toast. "Hydrate, then coffee, then beer. That is the gospel," he says.

"I thought the gospel was beer, beer, beer," I say.

"That's the epistle," he says, and I laugh because it's a good line and because I like it when he talks like that, like this place is a church and we are all pretending.

I drink the water. It tastes like pipes and a little bleach. It sits in my stomach like a cold stone. The coffee is bitter enough to make me wince. I drink it anyway. The caffeine is a small spark. It makes my hands shake less, or maybe I am imagining that too.

A couple of new arrivals come down the stairs, backpacks still on, faces bright and soft. One of them is wearing shower flip-flops already, rubber squeaking on the tile. I watch the flip-flops like they are a secret code.

"Welcome to Mad House," I call out, because I always do.

They laugh, because it sounds like a promise. The girl with the flip-flops smiles at me like she thinks I am part of the furniture. She is not wrong. I should ask their names. I don't.

I spend the next hour doing the tour, because Kuba asks and I say yes. I point out the wall of Polaroids, the shame board, the rage cage, the kitchen, the courtyard. I use the same jokes I always use. I mention the showers in the same half-joking tone, and they laugh. I tell them to wear thongs, to mind the pipe in the second stall, to be careful if they're still drunk. They nod like they understand, which is the same as not understanding.

One of the new guys, a tall Brit with a hoodie and a smile that suggests he thinks he can't be hurt, says, "Mate, I played rugby. I can handle a shower." Everyone laughs. I laugh too. The line between joke and warning holds steady, thin as a hair.

The tour ends in the courtyard, where the fountain coughs into a basin full of coins and cigarette butts. The air is cold and damp. The stone underfoot is slick. I step carefully. No one notices.

"You staying for the pub crawl?" I ask, because that is the question that keeps everything moving.

They all nod. One of them says, "It's why we're here." The words are innocent and heavy at the same time.

I watch them disperse into the bar and kitchen and dorms, their clean bags and clean faces soaking up the place like a sponge. I remember my first day here, when everything felt like a story waiting to be told. Now it feels like a story that keeps telling itself, no matter how many times I try to change the ending.

By afternoon, the hostel has warmed into its usual hum. The bar is lively but not yet frantic. Someone is playing cards at the long table. The kitchen smells like goulash and burnt onions. The courtyard is full of smoke and laughter. The dog from the courtyard wanders in and rests its head on my knee, a small, steady weight. I scratch behind its ear. It sighs like it understands me better than I do.

Liv finds me by the bar, cider in hand, a bruise on her shin like a tiny storm cloud. "You look less dead today," she says.

"Give it time," I say.

She smiles and clinks her glass against my beer. "To survival," she says.

"To bad decisions," I say.

We sit for a while, watching the room fill. She talks about Leeds and the rain there. I talk about the Gold Coast and the sun that makes you lie about how happy you are. We talk about nothing, which is how you talk when you want to avoid the something.

At some point, she asks, "You ever think about stopping?"

"Stopping what?" I say, even though I know.

She gestures at the bar, the cups, the neon, the way everyone seems to have a drink in their hand like it is part of their anatomy.

"Not really," I say. "This is what I'm good at. Not much else." The words are out before I can dress them up.

She looks at me, eyes soft. "Maybe you're good at more than you think." She means it. It scares me in a small, stupid way.

I change the subject. "You coming on the crawl tonight?"

"Maybe," she says, and we both laugh because we know what maybe means in this building.

The afternoon drifts. I play a few rounds of beer pong. I win one, lose one, and miss a shot that should have been easy. The ball arcs, hits the rim, bounces out. The table jeers. I laugh it off, but the miss sits in my chest, a small reminder that my body is not as steady as it used to be.

I step away and head toward the bathrooms to wash my hands after the game. The hallway is damp, the line of water still there, thinner now but not gone. The mop bucket under the stairs has been emptied and refilled. The drip keeps time.

In the bathroom, the light flickers. The sinks are crowded with bottles and toothbrushes. I wash my hands. The water is cold and metallic. As I dry them on my shorts, I look toward the stalls without meaning to.

The second stall is closed now, the curtain drawn. The pipe is hidden behind it. The floor around the drain is darker than the rest, a damp patch that refuses to dry. I hear a muffled cough from inside one of the stalls, then the sound of a body shifting. Someone is in there, someone I don't know, someone I might never see again. The thought makes the room feel smaller.

On the wall by the sinks, a new piece of graffiti has appeared: TAKE CARE OF YOUR HEAD. It is written in neat black letters, as if it is a reminder on a sticky note. Someone has drawn a little skull next to it. I touch the letters with a wet finger, then pull my hand away. The ink is dry, but the message sticks.

I leave the bathroom and the hallway feels like a lung, breathing out cold air. I step around the thin line of water and head back down. The bar noise swells around me like a wave.

I don't go into the bar. I take a left instead, down the narrow stairs to the basement, where the laundry machine lives next to the rage cage like two different kinds of confession. The stairwell is damp and smells like cold concrete and spilled beer. The rail is slick. I hold it anyway.

The basement is a cave in the literal sense. The ceiling is low. The light is yellow and tired. The air is thick with old moisture. The laundry machine sits in a corner with a hand-written sign taped to it: OUT OF ORDER, then a second note under it that says UN-OUT OF ORDER, and a third that says ASK KUBA. I stare at the signs like they might change if I look long enough.

There is a pile of damp sheets on a chair, a mound of fabric that looks like a sleeping animal. Someone has left a stack of coins on top of the machine, as if offering tribute. I reach into my pocket and find two Czech coins and a safety pin and a receipt from a kebab shop. Not enough to buy clean clothes, not enough to buy redemption. I leave the coins anyway. It feels like a ritual.

The rage cage is open, of course. It is not a cage, just a room with a couch and a speaker, but the name makes it feel like a place you can leave your manners. The couch is stained in the shape of a thousand nights. The walls are graffiti on graffiti, names and dates, doodled crowns and skulls. Someone has written DRY ME if you squint, like a prayer for laundry or for the soul. I chuckle, then stop because it isn't actually funny.

My singlet is damp and smells like stale smoke. My shorts are crusted with dried beer. I could wash them in the sink upstairs, but the thought of standing in the bathroom again, of that slick floor and the pipe in my peripheral vision, makes my chest tighten. I pull off the singlet and hand-wash it in the utility sink down here, the one that never fully drains. The water runs brown for a second, then clears. The metal basin is cold. The soap is a tiny bottle of hostel detergent that smells like lemons and regret. I scrub until the water turns gray. I rinse until my fingers go numb.

The sink clogs anyway. The water pools around my hands, a shallow lake of soap and whatever was on my shirt. I pull the plug with a wet slurp and the water drains slow, unwilling. It makes a sucking sound that feels too much like a mouth. I shake the shirt out and hang it on a pipe that runs along the wall. The pipe is warm, and for a second I think about it the way you think about a radiator in winter, a small, steady heat. Then I remember pipes can be more than that, and the thought goes cold.

My phone buzzes. I check it. A message from Mum: How's Prague today? The question is soft, like a hand on my shoulder. I sit on the edge of the couch and stare at the screen. The room smells like damp fabric and old beer. Somewhere above me, someone laughs. I type back, Great. Busy. Love you. I stare at the words. They look too clean to be true. I send them anyway.

The blue checkmark appears. It feels like a tiny verdict.

I lean back on the couch and let my head rest against the wall. The concrete is cool through my hair. I close my eyes for a second and the room spins, a slow carousel. The music from upstairs is muffled, a heartbeat through the floor. A drop of water lands on my forehead. I open my eyes and look up. A pipe runs along the ceiling with a bead of water swelling on it, fat and clear, before it falls. Drip. The droplet lands on my face, cold. I wipe it away and laugh softly, because of course even down here the water finds you.

I should go back up. I should not sit in a damp basement with my thoughts. The thoughts in basements are not kind. I stand, the room tipping slightly, and carry my damp shirt back toward the stairs. The floor is uneven, the concrete pitted. My flip-flops slap as I climb.

On the landing, I pause. From here I can see the mop bucket under the stairs above, the yellow caution sign leaning like a tired friend. The thin line of water snakes down the steps, just a little, glistening. I step carefully around it. I imagine what it would feel like to slip here, to go down the stairs with a wet back and a head full of nothing. I picture Marta finding me and swearing in Czech. I picture Kuba shaking his head and saying, Brad the Lad, mate. I shake the image away and keep climbing.

In the hallway, the air is cooler. I hang my shirt on the back of a chair outside the dorm because I don't want the damp smell in my bunk. The chair is already full of someone else's clothes. I add mine to the pile and it looks like a nest. I tell myself I will remember which one is mine. I tell myself a lot of things.

The dorm is empty for once. The sunlight that makes it in is thin and gray. The plastic mattress protector shines. The bucket in the corner is empty. I sit on my bunk and let my shoulders drop. My body feels heavy, like someone poured sand into my veins. I close my eyes and listen to the building. Pipes tick. The fan hums. A door opens and closes. The drip in the hall keeps time.

I should nap. I should take this as a sign, a pause, a moment to stop. I could lie down and let the quiet do its work. Instead I reach for my phone and open Instagram, because quiet is not my strong suit. I watch a story of myself from last night, laughing too loud, beer in hand. I look like I am having the best time. I look like a myth. I double-tap my own face and feel a tiny jolt of something that isn't joy.

The quiet in the dorm is too thick. I get up and head back down to the bar, because it is easier to be loud than to be alone with the drip.

By evening, the hostel has switched into its night skin. The lights are dimmer. The music is louder. The air is thick with bodies and heat. The courtyard is a haze of smoke under fairy lights. The rage cage opens in the basement. People begin to chant names like prayers.

I tell myself I will take it easy tonight. I tell myself I will drink water between beers. I tell myself I will leave early, get some sleep, call Mum in the morning. I say these things out loud to Liv. She raises an eyebrow and says, "Sure," which is her way of calling me out and letting me save face.

We do shots anyway. The first burns. The second warms. The third makes the room tilt in a way that feels almost comforting. The music turns into a heartbeat. People laugh. Someone spills a drink on my foot. I laugh and wipe it on my shorts. I am the guy people expect to be fine. I am good at being fine.

At some point, I end up in the courtyard with the tall Brit from the tour. He has a cigarette in his mouth and a beer in his hand. He slaps me on the shoulder and says, "Legendary place, mate. You're lucky to have found it." He says it like I chose this, like I hunted it down, like it didn't just happen to me.

"Yeah," I say. "Lucky." The word tastes like a joke.

He laughs and heads back inside. I stand for a minute, the cold air on my face, the smoke in my hair. The fountain coughs. The fairy lights flicker in the wind. The stones under my feet are wet, slick, a mirror for the lights. I think about the thin line of water in the hallway. I think about the pipe in the second stall. I think about the way my head feels when I move too fast.

My phone buzzes. I pull it out. A missed call from Mum. A message from my sister that says, Just checking in. The screen glows in the dark like a warning light on a dashboard. I stare at it, thumb hovering over the call button. I could call her now, with the music thumping behind me, with my voice still steady enough to pass. I could say, I'm fine, I'm alive, I'm not doing anything stupid.

I put the phone away.

Inside, the bar is louder. The night is in full swing. I go back because that is what I do.

Hours blur. I drink. I laugh. I lose track of time. Someone puts a plastic lei around my neck. Someone else tells me a story I pretend to listen to. Liv dances on a chair and nearly falls. I catch her and we laugh too hard. The room spins. I spin with it.

At three, I climb the stairs, legs heavy, head floating. The hallway is quiet and cold. The wet floor sign has fallen over again. The line of water is there, shining in the emergency light. I step around it, then back through it, then around it again, like I am testing the limits. I am not as steady as I think I am.

The bathroom door is half open. Light flickers inside. I stand in the hallway and look at it. The air smells like damp concrete and cheap soap. The sound of water is faint, a drip, a distant rush. My body wants the shower, the reset, the clean. My body also wants to sleep for a week.

I put my hand on the doorframe. The paint is chipped, rough under my fingers. I can see the second stall from here, just the edge of it, the curtain slightly open like a mouth. I can see the pipe glinting inside, a thin copper line in the dim light. The floor in front of it is dark and slick.

"Not tonight," I tell the door.

It is a promise. It is a lie. It is a thin line.

I go back to the dorm, climb into my bunk, and lie on my back. The mattress sticks to my skin. The air is damp. The room is quiet except for the drip in the hallway and the low hum of the building's old bones. My phone is under my pillow, a small weight I keep forgetting to lift.

I close my eyes and see the pipe. I see the line of water on the floor. I see my own head in the mirror, red-eyed and blurred. I tell myself tomorrow I will be careful. I will shower at a sensible hour, with my flip-flops on, with my head clear. I tell myself tomorrow I will be a different version of me.

The shower turns on somewhere down the hall. The water rushes, then roars. It is the sound of clean. It is the sound of a warning I keep pretending is a joke.

I let it lull me anyway.
