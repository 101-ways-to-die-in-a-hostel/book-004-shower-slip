# Chapter 02: The Out of Order Order

The knob turned like it had been waiting for my hand.

The sign that said SHOWERS OUT OF ORDER hung there with the stubbornness of paper that has been ignored before. It flapped when the hallway fan breathed, brushing my knuckles, and I thought about rules the way I always do—like a list that makes you a good person if you follow it, a bad one if you don't. I was already on the wrong side by the time I pushed the door open. The latch clicked with an old throat sound. The bathroom smelled more chemical than last night, the bleach turned up to eleven, and there was a second smell beneath it, stale and mineral, like a bag of old coins left in the rain.

The fluorescent light flickered once, as if it had to decide whether to witness this.

Inside, the floor was wet in the wrong places. The mats had been stacked in a corner, a damp pile of foam that made me think of a dog bed. The stalls were closed, curtain edges bowed inward by humidity. The sinks ran along the left wall like a line of stripped porcelain teeth. There was another sign above them: USE SINKS FOR WASHING. DO NOT ENTER SHOWER AREA. The handwriting was the same as the Please Do Not Die note, the kind of neat caps people use when they are serious and joking at the same time.

I took my toiletries out anyway. The sink was shallow and stained from hard water. I ran the tap. It gurgled, then spit, then came out hot enough that I pulled my hand back. The water smelled faintly metallic. I cupped it over my face, tried to make it feel like a shower, and failed. The mirror in front of me was spiderwebbed with hairline cracks that reflected me in pieces. My eyes were two separate concerns.

Behind me, a stall door creaked. I froze, soap in my palm, and turned so slowly I felt ridiculous. The stall was closed. No one else. The sound must have been the building settling, the pipes shifting, or maybe the curtain edge sticking to itself in the wet. I held my breath anyway. The moment stretched until it was silly. I let it go.

I am not superstitious, but there is a thin line between not believing in ghosts and not wanting to find out if you are wrong. I moved the rest of my washing to the sink, splashing water across the tile by accident. It puddled, glossy and dark, an inappropriate sheen in a room that felt like a warning.

The faucet shuddered, then calmed. The water grew cold. I was half-lathered, hair full of foam, when it turned hot again. I stood there under a stream from a sink, head bent, towel around my shoulders, trying to imitate the luxury of a shower while feeling the indignity of it in my spine.

There was a sound in the wall, low and round, the whale noise Luz had described. It came from the pipes above the stalls, a groan that made the tiles vibrate under my bare feet. The thin line of water I had spilled shivered, tiny ripples. I looked toward the shower area with a mixture of curiosity and stubbornness.

The curtains were still.

I could have left. I could have listened to the sign. The idea of leaving with shampoo still in my hair made my skin crawl. It was not about cleanliness. It was about the control of finishing what I had started, the discipline of routine. I turned the faucet to the hottest setting and rinsed. My scalp prickled, my fingers went slightly numb, but I felt done when I was done.

When I stepped back, the towel brushed the sink and knocked a plastic cup onto the floor. It skittered across the wet tile and stopped with its rim against the stack of mats. There was a dark patch under the mats I had not seen before, dampness that crept out like a stain. I hesitated, then nudged the mats with my toe. They were heavier than they should have been, waterlogged, and underneath them the tile was cracked in a long, uneven line. The line was brown with grime and whatever else had seeped in. It could have been old. It could have been new. In a building this old, those are the same thing.

I put the mats back where they were. I dried my hands and my face. The mirror showed me as a broken collection of a person, and I turned away.

By the time I got to the common room, my hair was a damp mess and the coffee was too small. Luz was behind the bar again, cleaning the same glass I had seen her clean last night. She looked up as if she had been waiting for evidence.

"You ignored the sign," she said.

"I complied with it," I said. "Sink shower. The saddest shower. There should be a tax deduction."

She held the glass up to the light. "They shut the showers for a reason. The water pressure is a drunk. It comes, it goes, it slams. You are not the first to ignore the sign."

"Am I the first to survive?" I said, and she let out a laugh that made two Australians at the long table glance over.

"We are all survivors," she said. "Sometimes for too long." She set the glass down and poured me coffee without asking. I liked that about her. It felt like a kind of care that did not make a fuss.

The courtyard was already alive with morning. A French guy was frying eggs in the kitchen, humming a song I recognized but could not place. The dog was in the doorway, a sentinel against crumbs. A British woman in a bucket hat was tapping out a blog post with the intensity of a crime report. The sign-up board for tonight's pub crawl had three names. Niko's handwriting was there, slanted, with a number of little hearts drawn beside it. I wondered if he wrote his name like that for everything.

I opened my laptop, and my inbox opened its mouth. The Zurich client had replied, three bullets of feedback and a passive-aggressive smiley face. My body tried to tense. I drank my coffee instead. The coffee was worse today. It had that burnt citrus bitterness. I wrote back, pasted the template apology, and tried to make my tone lighter than my morning. I told myself I could do this work anywhere, which is a lie. You can do work anywhere, but you do not become the same person in every place.

Marisol dropped onto the bench across from me with a plate of fruit. "You look like you got baptized in a sink," she said.

"I did," I said. "It's a new wellness trend. Five stars."

She laughed and pushed a piece of papaya toward me. "Any luck with the showers?"

"Out of order. I broke the rules." I told her about the mats, the crack, the whale.

Her smile thinned. "They close them every few days. Old pipes. I told you."

"And yet I am still here," I said. "Should I be more worried?"

She shrugged. "You are always worried. It is your brand."

It stung because it was true. Even when I pretend to be spontaneous, my anxiety is visible like a faint watermark. I told myself to laugh it off and then did. I took a photo of my coffee, filtered it into a kind of golden honesty, and posted it with a caption about adapting. The comments came quickly. My friends think I am brave for taking a sink shower in a hostel they will never see.

Luz set a bowl of sugar packets on our table. "I need a favor," she said. "If you see the maintenance guy, tell him to stop leaving the mop bucket under the stairs. Someone is going to slip."

"You're telling the wrong person," I said, nodding to my knee.

"Exactly," she said. "You know how it feels."

I made a note in my brain. I am very good at making notes I forget to carry out.

Around noon, the city began to boil. The air had that wet metallic flavor it gets before a storm. The courtyard plants hung like damp towels. I closed my laptop when the Wi‑Fi hiccuped and tried to pretend I was on a break, that this was what I had wanted all along. I walked up to the rooftop terrace because someone in the kitchen said there was a view. The stairs were narrow and uneven. The paint on the banister flaked into my palm. Halfway up, I stopped to catch my breath and realized I had climbed too fast, or maybe the heat was already messing with me.

The roof was a square of faded tile and plastic chairs. From up there, you could see the sea, a flat gray sheet, and the old part of town, roofs like dull coins. The hostel's roof had a low wall with a chipped mosaic of saints and waves. Someone had painted a small skull on it, almost hidden in the grout. I took a picture. Everything about this place felt like a hint.

A couple was up there already, the linen duo from the dorm. They were taking turns taking photos of each other on the ledge, framing the sea just right, the kind of image you see on a travel brand's mood board. I nodded, sat in the corner, and let the breeze dry my hair. It brought the smell of salt and a faint tang of sewage. Below, the city sounded like motorbikes and shouts and a radio that could not tune itself.

When I went back down, the stairs seemed steeper. The banister was slick with humidity. At the landing, there was a bucket and mop, exactly where Luz said it was. The bucket was filled with gray water, and the mop leaned at an angle like it had been abandoned in the middle of a sentence. I stared at it for a moment, then stepped around, because my brain loves to notice problems and my body loves to ignore them.

In the corridor, I nearly collided with a man carrying a box of tools. He had a mustache that curled like a question mark and a blue work shirt that said RICARDO in white letters. He stopped short, and a wrench clanked against the side of the box.

"Sorry," I said. "Are you the maintenance guy?"

He nodded, eyes tired. "Everybody's maintenance guy," he said. His accent was local. He had a voice that sounded like he smoked but didn't want to.

"Tell Luz I saw you," I said. "She says stop leaving the mop bucket under the stairs."

He smiled without humor. "Tell Luz to stop moving the bucket. I left it there because the floor leaks."

"The floor leaks?" I asked.

He shifted the box in his arms. "The pipe in the ceiling. It drips. If I do not leave the bucket, it drips on the stairs. People slip. If I leave the bucket, people slip. I choose which slip I want."

It was a tidy piece of logic. I nodded as if I understood. "Is the bathroom fixed?" I asked.

He glanced toward the end of the hall. "Not yet. The pressure is wrong. There is air in the line. It screams."

"It screams?"

He shrugged, as if I was the one making this strange. "The pipes talk when they are old. It is normal." He walked away, the tools rattling softly like a box of teeth.

I watched him go, then noticed a thin line of water on the floor near the stairs, a trail that ended at the bucket. The tile there was worn smoother than the rest, polished by years of feet. It looked like a place made for falling.

I told myself I was not going to fall. I am good at telling myself that.

In the afternoon, the hostel tried to be charming. A cooking class started in the kitchen, the smell of onions and lime filling the common room. A group from Chile set up a speaker and played a song that made the courtyard feel like a bar before it opens. I edited a photo of the cracked tile, made it black-and-white, and considered posting it. I decided against it. It felt like tempting fate to post the thing that had almost taken me. I posted the courtyard instead. People love plants.

At three, the electricity cut for ten minutes. The fan in the dorm stopped. The hostel became a damp cave. Someone shouted from the corridor. I took the opportunity to take a cold shower in the sink again, because apparently my life is a slow lesson in humility. This time, the faucet coughed out air, then water, then a weird brown stream that smelled faintly of salt. I stopped, waited, and tried again. It ran clear. I washed quickly, then stood there with the towel around my shoulders, thinking about how the water had run brown for a second and how nobody had said that was normal.

The sign on the bathroom door was gone by then. The showers were still closed. The mats were still stacked, heavy and damp. The crack beneath them seemed wider, or maybe I was only now paying attention. I did not tell anyone. I did not take a photo. I did not want to be the person who complained about a crack in the tile. People in hostels complain about bigger things. People in hostels are in the business of pretending the place is part of their adventure, not part of their safety record.

Late afternoon, I went out into the city to buy a new SD card. The street outside La Cardenal was a narrow vein of vendors and traffic. A man sold ripe mangos from a cart, slicing them into flowers. Motorbikes threaded between pedestrians like they were on a separate set of rules. I bought the SD card from a shop that sold phone cases and expired gum. The shop smelled like plastic and dust. The man behind the counter had a scar on his cheek that looked like he had been kissed by a knife.

On my way back, I stopped at a corner bar because it was too hot and I needed the kind of salt you can only get from a cheap beer. The bar was empty except for an old woman watching a soap opera on a TV that was too small for the room. She did not look up. I drank my beer slowly, listened to the sound of the city outside, and thought about calling my mother. I did not.

When I returned to the hostel, the courtyard was shaded, and the dog was awake, sniffing the edges of the fountain. The fountain water was lower than yesterday, the leaves collected in a ring like a crown. I tossed the dog a piece of bread. It sniffed it, then walked away. I am used to being ignored by dogs and algorithms.

Niko found me by the kitchen sink, refilling my water bottle. "You missed the market," he said. "There was a fish the size of my arm."

"I got a beer the size of my disappointment," I said.

He laughed. "And the shower?"

"Out of order. Sink life."

"It is better that way. The showers here are a hazard. They used to be part of the bathhouse, you know. The tile is older than the internet. It is cursed." He said this with the easy sincerity of a man who has not worked a day job in years.

"Cursed how?" I asked, because I did not want to and because I did.

"People slip. People crack their heads. The water goes hot and cold like it is playing with you. There was a girl last year, a Brazilian girl, she broke her wrist. She sued, maybe. Or she left. Everyone leaves eventually."

He said it like a proverb. I nodded, feeling the cold bead of my water bottle against my palm. "Do you believe in curses?" I asked.

"I believe in old buildings," he said. "They have memory. They are like old men. They will not move for you."

I wanted to make a joke about old men and slippery tile. I did not. The word memory stuck in my head. I thought about the cracked ceiling, the line of water, the brown stream from the faucet. It all felt like the building's way of telling a story. I just could not read it yet.

At dinner, the hostel served lentils and rice. I sat with Marisol and a German guy named Kai who was traveling with a ukulele and too much enthusiasm. He played a song about the ocean, and everyone pretended to like it. Luz poured rum for the table and said it was on the house because it was too warm for dignity. I took a shot and felt my throat burn clean.

"You should post the bathroom sign," Kai said when I told him about it. "It would be funny."

"Funny like a warning," Marisol said.

"Funny like irony," I said. I thought about the sign again, about the words PLEASE DO NOT DIE in that neat handwriting. The humor of it was a soft cushion around the idea. I wondered how many people had laughed at that sign and then walked into the shower anyway. I wondered if I would be able to laugh if it had been me.

The rum made the evening softer. People moved to the courtyard with their drinks, the mosquito coils smoking on the tables like tiny altars. Someone turned on a string of lights. The fountain looked black in the dark. The dog curled in a corner, its paws twitching in dreams. Niko told a story about sleeping in a cathedral in Poland. Marisol told a story about a hostel in Lima where the door locked from the outside. I told a story about getting food poisoning in Budapest and pretending it was a hangover. We all laughed in the way you do when you have to make light of the choices that put you here.

At some point, I felt my phone vibrate. A message from my client: *Any update?* The question sat there like a finger tapping my forehead. I excused myself, went inside, and opened my laptop. The common room was empty now, the neon sign buzzing. I typed for an hour, trying to make their product feel light and authoritative. I worked in a room that smelled like stale coffee and the ghost of cigarettes. I worked until the tension in my shoulders made me stand and stretch.

When I walked down the hallway to the dorm, I heard the shower running. It was a steady sound, not a drip, not a sputter. Someone had decided the sign did not apply to them. The water pounded, and the pipes groaned in answer. I paused outside the bathroom door, not sure why. I could hear the water hit tile. I could hear someone humming, a low tune. I stood there, towel in my hands, my body registering the old fear and the new curiosity.

The humming stopped. The water continued. A moment later, the door opened, and the Canadian guy from my dorm walked out. He was shirtless, hair plastered to his head, steam following him like a cloak. He looked content, as if he had just been refreshed by a god he trusted.

"Showers are back?" I asked.

"For now," he said. He had a towel around his waist. "Pressure's a bit wild, but it works."

"How wild?" I asked.

He grinned. "Think roller coaster."

I thanked him and let him pass. The bathroom door was half open now, a rectangle of light and steam. I could smell eucalyptus and hot tile. My towel felt suddenly too dry in my hands. I did not go in. I went to the dorm and sat on my bunk, listening to the pipes as they cooled down. The sound of the shower was like someone clapping slowly in another room.

When I finally lay down, my phone buzzed again. This time it was my mother. I stared at her name for too long, then answered.

"Hello?" she said, voice small through the cheap hostel connection.

"Hi," I said, and it came out softer than I meant.

"How's the trip?" she asked. "You safe?"

"Yeah," I said. I did not tell her about the shower. I did not tell her about the sign or the crack or the whale. I told her about the courtyard, the coffee, the dog. I told her a version of the truth that would not make her worry. She told me about the neighbor's cat, about the weather. It was ordinary in the way that makes you remember what you are missing.

"You eating?" she asked.

"Yeah," I said, though I had had only lentils and rum. "Don't worry."

"I always worry," she said, and I thought of the sign that said PLEASE DO NOT DIE and how that sounded like her on a postcard.

After we hung up, I lay in the dark and listened to the hostel settle. The fan whirred. Someone snored. The pipes knocked softly, cooling, like a boat rubbing against a dock. In the hallway, a door opened and closed. The building creaked. I tried to sleep and found myself thinking about Ricardo's words: the pipes talk when they are old. The pipes talk. The pipes talk.

I drifted into a dream where the bathrooms were a maze, every stall a separate room, every curtain a mouth. Water ran from the ceiling in thin sheets, and the floors were glass. I stepped and slid and slid and never reached a wall. A voice in the wall whispered, but I could not understand it because I was under water.

I woke at three a.m. to the sound of running water. Not the bathroom this time. It was deeper, more distant, like a river behind the wall. The air in the dorm was damp, the fan pushing a wet weight around. My skin felt clammy. I listened. The water kept going, a steady rush. I wondered if someone had left a shower running, if the pipe had burst. I pictured the crack under the mats, the damp stain. I pictured the bucket under the stairs. I pictured all the warnings I had stepped around today.

I got up, careful not to wake anyone, and opened the dorm door. The hallway was dim, lit by a single emergency bulb. The floor was dark and shiny in a strip that ran from the bathroom door to the stairs, a trail of water. It glimmered as if it had been painted there. I took one step out and felt the tile under my foot shift with slickness. I froze. My hand went to the wall.

The sound of water was louder in the hall. It poured from somewhere I could not see. The bathroom door was closed. The light inside was off. The sound was not from there. It was from above, from inside the walls. The building was speaking in its throat language.

I stood there in my bare feet, towel around my waist, and felt the corridor tilt in my mind. The trail of water ran down the stairs, into the darkness. I looked toward the stairs, toward the bucket I knew was there. I imagined it overflowing, the tile polishing itself to glass. I imagined someone waking up, half asleep, stepping into that slickness. I imagined my mother saying, *Are you safe?*

I should have gone back to bed. I should have woken someone. Instead, I walked toward the stairs, hand on the wall, because I had already started the story and wanted to see how it ended.

The water kept running.
