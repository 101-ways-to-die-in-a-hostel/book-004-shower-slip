# Chapter 03: Hair of the Dog

I wake up with my face stuck to a plastic mattress protector and a drum solo playing inside my skull.

The drum solo is mine. So is the smell. The room is a wet zoo of bodies, beer, and the distinct tang of someone else's regret. Twelve bunks, twelve people, one window cracked open to a courtyard that is already shouting. My mouth tastes like the bottom of a pub. I swallow and my throat scratches back, like it knows I have not been kind to it.

There is a sock on my pillow. It is not my sock. It is damp. I peel it off and toss it toward the pile of clothes by the door, which is less of a pile and more of an archaeological site.

Someone on the top bunk wheezes like a dying accordion. A phone alarm goes off and no one moves. The bass from the bar downstairs is still thumping, as if it never sleeps. I check my own phone. Four new likes, two comments, one missed call from my sister, and a notification that my story hit 1.2K views. The story is me at 3 a.m. doing a shot from a boot, eyes red, captioned DAY 14 IN PRAGUE STILL GOING STRONG. I hit replay. I look like a legend. I look like a warning.

I tell myself I am just hungover. I tell myself the shaking in my hands is because I have not eaten. I tell myself it is normal for my heart to gallop when I sit up. It is all just the same old. The same old is a full-time job.

My name is Brad. If you have met me in a hostel bar, you probably called me Brad the Lad, because that is the easiest nickname in the world and because I did not stop you. I am twenty-two, Australian, six foot one, and built like a gym poster that lost its sponsor. My hair is sun-bleached at the tips and I have a Southern Cross tattoo on my shoulder that I got when I was seventeen and still thought being reckless was a personality and not a warning sign.

I am not sober enough to make breakfast, so I drink water from a bottle on the floor. It has a floaty in it that might be lime, might be a mosquito. I take another swig anyway. My stomach does a slow roll. I sit on the edge of the bunk, elbows on knees, breathing through my mouth so I do not have to smell the room.

This is Mad House Prague, which is not a name so much as a dare. The hostel has a reputation. The hostel has a bar that never closes. The hostel has a wall of Polaroids like a proof-of-life board. The hostel has a thing called the rage cage in the basement, which is just a storage room with a couch but sounds so good you have to see it.

I have been here two weeks, which is a long time to live inside a dare. I came for three nights. I kept saying one more. You do not have to unpack when you keep saying one more. Your stuff can stay in the same pile by the door. You can keep your brain in the same pile, too.

The guy in the bunk across from me lifts his head and looks at me with the glassy eyes of a man who lost a fight with tequila. He is wearing shower flip-flops on the bed like he fell asleep halfway through getting clean. He looks down at his feet and smiles like he just remembered a joke, then drops back down and pulls the blanket over his face.

I should get a shower. The thought of standing under cold water is the only thing that makes the room feel survivable. The thought of standing, though, makes the room tilt. I look at the bruise on my hip, blue and yellow, a landscape I do not remember earning. I ran into a door last night, or I fell off a chair, or I got in a friendly wrestle that went unfriendly for a second. The details are a fog. The bruise is not. It aches when I breathe.

It is fine. I am fine. I am always fine.

I pull on board shorts and a singlet, because I dress like I am always on my way to a beach that never arrives. The floor is cold under my feet. I find my thongs by smell more than sight. Someone has scrawled SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD on the back of the door in black marker. I read it every morning. I laugh every morning. It is the closest thing I have to a morning prayer.

The hallway is a tunnel of graffiti and damp. The paint is layered so thick it looks like it is dripping. There is a stencil of a skull wearing sunglasses. There is a list of countries with checkmarks, as if the wall itself has traveled. There is a sticky patch on the floor that grabs my feet for a second before letting go.

At the end of the hall, the bathroom door is propped open with a mop bucket. A cleaner is on her knees, wiping the floor with the kind of resigned fury you only get after decades of trying to make chaos behave. Marta, I think her name is. There are always two Martas. She has a cigarette tucked behind one ear and another in her mouth, unlit. The smell of bleach and mildew hits me like a slap.

"Morning," I say.

She looks up. "You are still alive," she says, as if it is a mild surprise.

"Barely," I say. "Need a shower. Or a priest. Either works."

She points the mop at the showers. "Dodgy as," she says, the accent on her English bending the word into a warning. "Floor wet. Pipe loose. Not your day."

"It is never my day," I say.

She snorts and keeps mopping. The water she pushes toward the drain runs slow, lazy, like it does not want to leave. There is a dark patch of mold near the drain, a green-black smear that looks like something grew there and then died.

I look at the second shower stall, the one with no tiles. It is just concrete, slick and shiny, as if someone polished it with their body. There is an exposed copper pipe where a shower head used to be, capped but still jutting out like a knuckle. I try not to stare at it. I have stared at it before. We all have. The pipe is a landmark at this point.

"Just do not fall," Marta says, reading my face.

"No worries," I say. "I never fall."

I have no towel because I never remember to bring a towel. I grab my shirt and dry my face, which is pathetic but efficient. I decide to wait until later for the shower. It is a smart decision, which means it will not stick.

Downstairs, the bar is in its morning phase, which is mostly just coffee and regret. The lights are still dim. The smell is of stale beer, toast, and mop water. Jakub is at reception, tapping on his phone with the ease of a man who has given up on rest. He looks up and grins.

"Brad the Lad," he says. "You alive."

"Barely," I say, which is how I answer everything now.

He pours me a coffee that tastes like punishment and slides a shot of something clear across the counter. "Hair of the dog," he says. "It is from the dog."

"Legend," I say, and knock it back.

The shot burns clean and bright. My stomach lurches, then settles. The edges of the room sharpen. The wall of Polaroids glows in the low light, little squares of people who look like they are trying to prove that their joy was real. There is one of me on the wall, arms around two British guys, my tongue out. The caption under it says BRAD THE LAD. I did not write that. I feel proud anyway.

A new group comes down the stairs, backpacks still full, faces still hopeful. A tall girl with a beanie looks around like she is expecting a brochure. I put on my smile and my voice, the loud one, the one that makes people believe I know what I am doing.

"You just get in?" I ask. "Welcome to the madhouse. This place is hectic." I throw my arms wide like I am the manager.

They laugh. They relax. I feel like a good person for making them relax.

"First drink is free," I say, pointing at Jakub. "Rules are simple. No drugs, no drama, no puking in the dorms. The bar never closes. The showers are a bit dodgy, so wear thongs or whatever. And if someone hands you absinthe, just say yes."

The tall girl looks at the stairs leading to the dorms, then back at me. "Is it safe?" she asks.

I should say something honest. I should mention the pipe. The mold. The floor. The way Marta's mop bucket never seems to leave the door. I should mention the guy who split his chin last week and blamed the stairs. I should mention the girl who slipped in the shower and laughed while bleeding.

"Safe enough," I say. "You just gotta watch your step when you're pissed."

She nods. She looks relieved. I take another sip of coffee and hate myself a little for a second, then the second passes.

Jakub slides me another coffee because he knows I will take it. "You coming to recovery beers at noon?" he asks.

"Wouldn't miss it," I say. "Got to stay hydrated." He laughs like it is a good joke. It is a good joke. It is also a bad plan.

I take my coffee to the common room and sit on the couch, which is as sticky as a promise. Someone has left a plate of toast on the table, and a fly is doing circles around it. I eat one piece, because it feels like a responsible act and because I need something to soak up the shot.

The morning crawls. I scroll through my notifications. I watch a video of myself chugging a beer to a cheer. I do not remember doing it. My Instagram DM has a message from a girl in Barcelona. I do not open it. My sister has sent another text. I do not open it either. If I do not open them, they do not count. That is how I live now.

At noon, the bar is full again. The recovery beers are a thing here, a ritual. People line up like pilgrims. The beer is cheap and cold. The first sip is a mercy. The second sip feels like success. The third sip makes the room feel like it is holding still.

I join a beer pong game and I am still good at it, which is both a skill and a curse. My hand is steady when it needs to be. The ball arcs and lands in the cup. Everyone cheers. I am the guy they want on their team. The world feels less heavy when the ball goes where I want it.

Somebody puts on a playlist that has been called "Bangers" by eight different people. The bass rattles the windows. The air warms. The smell of beer mixes with sweat and cheap cologne. The dog from the courtyard wanders in and sits under the table, eyes hopeful. I toss it a chip. It ignores me, because I am not actually interesting to dogs.

I feel the bruise on my hip again. It pulses when I lean. I tell myself I should take it easy. I also tell myself I have a reputation to maintain. The second voice is louder.

By mid-afternoon, the rain starts. You can hear it on the courtyard tiles, a hard, sudden drumming. People gather at the windows to watch the courtyard flood. The drain clogs. Someone takes a video and posts it with a caption about vibes. Marta comes out with a mop and curses in Czech. The rain makes the air smell like wet concrete and old beer.

I wander toward the stairs because I need to pee and because walking keeps me from thinking. The floor of the hallway is wet from the mop bucket again. The bucket is under the stairs, catching the drip from the ceiling. The water in it is brown and frothy. A thin line of water snakes across the tile toward the bathrooms.

"Careful," Marta says as I pass. "You all dance, you all fall."

"Not me," I say, because I always say it.

In the bathroom, the mirror is fogged even though no one is showering. The air is humid and stale. The sinks are half clogged with hair. I do my business and wash my hands, the water cold enough to sting. I notice dried blood on the wall near the second stall, a faint rust-colored smear that could be a paint drip, could be something else. The graffiti on the wall says LIVE FAST DIE LATER in blue marker. Someone has drawn a little skull under it. I laugh. Dark humor is how we do safety here.

A guy in the stall next to me finishes peeing and comes out wearing shower flip-flops. He looks at me, sees my bare feet, raises his eyebrows.

"You're a brave man," he says.

"Reckon I'll survive," I say.

"Yeah, until you don't," he says, and walks out.

It is funny in the moment. It sticks in my ribs later.

The rain keeps going, a steady percussion, and the common room fills with the slow restlessness of people who can not drink their way out of the afternoon. I decide to go outside for food, because my stomach is starting to mutiny and because the air in the hostel has a way of making me feel like I am living inside a glass. I grab my jacket, which still smells like smoke from Berlin, and step into the street.

Prague in the rain is a postcard someone spilled on. The cobblestones shine. The streetlights glow soft and yellow even though it is still daylight. A tram slides past with a squeal like a big animal. I cross the road toward a stall selling trdelnik, the sugary chimney thing everyone posts about. The seller is a kid with a beanie and a cigarette, hands moving fast. I buy one and burn my tongue on the sugar. It is too sweet, which is exactly what I need.

I walk a block, chewing, watching tourists take photos of a statue that I have seen a hundred times now and still have not looked at properly. There is a pub on the corner, dark and warm, and the smell of goulash drifts out the door. I think about going in, then do not, because it feels like a betrayal to the hostel bar. Loyalty is a dumb thing to feel about a place that charges five euros for a beer, but I feel it anyway.

The rain makes my bones feel heavier. I pull my hood up and head back. A car splashes through a puddle, cold water up my calves. I laugh, because getting soaked by a car in Prague feels like a story you are supposed to tell later. I take a quick video of my wet shoes and post it with the caption PRAGUE TRIED TO TAKE ME OUT. People send laughing emojis. The moment feels smaller than the screen makes it.

Back at the hostel, the hallway smells sharper, like bleach fighting a losing battle. There is a guy in a blue work shirt near the bathroom door, a box of tools open on the floor. He is crouched under the sink, the muscles in his forearm flexing as he tightens something. A copper pipe rests against the wall beside him, stripped and wet. He looks up as I pass, eyes tired.

"Pipe's out again," he says, more to himself than to me.

"That so?" I say. I am halfway to the stairs before I realize I have stopped.

"Pressure keeps kicking," he says. "Old building. Old pipes. The water don't listen." He wipes his hands on his shirt. There is a stain on his knuckles like dried rust.

"Water never listens," I say, which is a stupid thing to say but feels true. He looks at me for a second like he is deciding whether to say something else, then turns back to the sink.

I keep walking. The stairs are slick with rainwater from my shoes. The banister is cold. On the landing, someone has drawn a cartoon of a shower head crying. I laugh even though it is not really funny.

By six, the hostel is fully awake. The pre-game starts. There is a theme tonight, something with tropical shirts and fake mustaches. I put on a shirt someone hands me and stick a plastic lei around my neck. I drink a beer because it is there. I drink another because it is not.

At some point, I end up giving a tour of the hostel to two Americans who look like they are not used to hostels that smell like a bar. I show them the bar. I show them the kitchen. I show them the wall of Polaroids. I do not show them the rage cage because it is not ready. I do not show them the bathroom because it is not a selling point.

"We call that the health hazard room," I say, nodding toward the bathroom door anyway, because I cannot resist the joke.

They laugh. The guy says, "For real?"

"Nah, she's fine," I say. "Just don't slip when you're pissed." The words fall out without thought. They feel lighter than they should.

The night gets loud. The night gets blurry. There are shots. There is absinthe. There is a drinking game called Ring of Fire. There is a moment in the kitchen where I have my arm around a guy named Felix and I tell him I love him even though I met him an hour ago. There is a moment outside when the rain stops and the street smells like cigarettes and wet stone. There is a moment when I check my phone and see my sister's name and then put it face down.

At midnight, the group goes to a club. I go with them because I always go with them. We spill out into Prague in a noisy herd. The city is beautiful and dark, all cobblestones and yellow light. The Vltava glints like a blade. Tourists stumble and shout. A tram screeches past. I shout something about being a legend. Someone agrees. That is all you need to keep going.

Inside the club, the music is a physical thing, pushing against my ribs. I dance with a girl who smells like gin and oranges. I do not remember her name. I tell her my name is Brad the Lad and she laughs like she has heard that before. I keep drinking because my body is already running on it. I keep smiling because that is the role. I keep forgetting because forgetting feels like relief.

At three, we stumble back to the hostel. The hallway is a tunnel again. The bar is still open. The lights are lower now, like the place is trying to pretend it is asleep. The dog is curled on the couch. The rage cage door is open, and inside someone is passed out in a chair with their head on their chest, a human punctuation mark.

I go upstairs, laughing too loud. I trip on the last step and catch myself on the railing, my palm stinging. Someone shouts, "Oi, Brad!" I throw a thumbs up. I am fine. I am always fine.

In the dorm, I drop onto my bunk and pull off my shirt. My head spins. The room is darker, the air thicker. The guy with the flip-flops is asleep, snoring like a chainsaw. Someone has vomited in a bucket by the door and missed a little. The smell is sharp and sour. I roll onto my side to avoid it and end up staring at the wall, which is covered in photos and a sign that says DO NOT DIE IN HERE. It is supposed to be funny. It feels like a dare.

This is the part no one sees. The part where the party turns off like a light and I am just a bloke in a bunk with a body that feels like it has been used as a drum. My heart is too loud in my ears. My hands are still shaking. The room sways when I close my eyes. I am not drunk enough to sleep. I am too drunk to stop thinking.

I think about my mum texting me last week. I think about my sister calling and how I did not answer. I think about the girl in Barcelona who asked me if I was okay and the way I laughed and said, "Fully, mate," because that is what I say. I think about the bruise on my hip. I think about the bucket under the stairs. I think about the bathroom floor, the mold by the drain, the pipe sticking out like a tooth.

The fear comes up like a tide. It is not about dying. It is about stopping. It is about waking up and realizing the party is over and I am still here, still empty, still not sure what I do without it. The fear is that I am a joke that has stopped being funny.

I open Instagram again, because the glow is easier than the dark. I scroll through my own feed. Me in Berlin, me in Amsterdam, me in Budapest with a beer in each hand. People comment LEGEND, KING, BRO. I double-tap a photo of myself. I hate myself for a second. I double-tap it again.

My phone buzzes with a message from my mum. I open it because I am lonely. It says, "Hope you're safe. Call when you can. Love you." I stare at it until the words blur. I want to call her. I do not call her. I put the phone face down and tell myself I will call her tomorrow. Tomorrow is a word I use like a condom, a promise of protection that does not always work.

The dorm hums around me. The pipes tick. The building is old and tired and full of water it cannot control. Somewhere down the hall, a faucet drips in a steady rhythm. Drip. Drip. Drip. It sounds like a countdown.

I close my eyes and try to sleep. The mattress is thin. The plastic protector sticks to my skin. The air is cold on my damp hair. My heart keeps fluttering, a moth inside a jar. I imagine the shower. I imagine the cold water. I imagine the shock that might clear my head. I imagine the drain swallowing the dirt off my skin. I imagine the pipe and how close it is when you lean back.

At four, I sit up and swing my legs over the side of the bunk. I should not. I am still drunk. I am still spinning. I am still thinking about the shower like it is a solution.

"Sleep when I'm dead," I whisper, because it is what I always say and because saying it makes the idea feel like a joke again.

I stand. The floor tilts a little. I steady myself on the bunk frame. My head throbs in time with the drip down the hall. I grab my towel from the hook, my toiletry bag from the pile, and I walk into the corridor, barefoot, a towel over my shoulder like a flag.

The hallway is empty. The emergency light near the stairwell flickers. The bathroom door is open. The air smells like mildew and soap and the damp concrete that never dries. I can hear water in the pipes. It is not running yet, just waiting.

I stop outside the bathroom and look at the floor. It shines. The mop bucket is still by the stairs, the water inside it still catching the drip from the ceiling. The line of water runs toward the bathroom like a trail.

I take a step closer.

The pipe inside the second stall glints in the light.

I do not go in. Not yet. I turn my head back toward the dorm and tell myself I will do it in the morning, when the floor is dry and the light is better and I am not still drunk. The thought of standing under water again is stronger than the thought of sleep, but sleep wins. It always does.

I go back to bed. The towel stays on my shoulder for a while, warm and damp. The drip keeps time. The pipe waits.
