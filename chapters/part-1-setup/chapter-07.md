# Chapter 07: The Recovery Gospel

The first time I open my eyes, the room is still moving, and I have to decide if it is me or the building.

The answer is both. The hostel has a permanent sway, like it is on a boat, like it is leaning into the next night even when the sun is up. The mattress is damp with the sweat of strangers, and my pillow smells like a bar towel. My throat is dry enough to crack. The air is a thick soup of old beer, body heat, and the faint chemical tang of cheap cleaner they sprayed and forgot to wipe.

My phone is a brick on my chest. It buzzes, once, like an accusation.

I slide it off and look. No new messages, just the time: 10:07. I missed breakfast, which means I missed the only thing in this building that pretends to be healthy. I roll onto my side and hear my head slosh like a half-full bottle. There is a bruise on my hip the size of a palm. I push at it and get a memory I can't place: a stone bench, laughter, me on the ground, someone shouting my name like it's a party trick.

A guy in the bunk across from me is snoring like a chainsaw. Someone else has an arm flung out of their blanket, hand dangling, fingers gray in the cold light. There is a sock stuck between the bed slats above, still waving its surrender. The radiator clicks and hisses like it's annoyed to be alive.

I sit up slowly. The room tilts and then settles, like a thought I don't want to have. My stomach is hollow in a way that feels like a threat, but it is also angry, like it has been taken for granted too many nights in a row. I take a breath through my mouth to avoid the bucket smell and swing my legs down.

The floor is sticky. It makes that awful sound when my flip-flops peel up, like I'm ripping tape off skin. I am already in my board shorts from last night. I find my singlet on the floor and pull it on, the cotton damp and cold. My towel is hanging on the bunk rail, still wet, still smelling like mildew. I put it around my neck and pretend it's fresh.

The hallway outside is quiet in the way a battlefield is quiet after the guns stop. There is always a moment in the morning when Mad House looks almost like a normal hostel. Then someone vomits and the spell breaks.

The bathroom door is open. I can hear the drip of a tap that never fully closes and the hum of the old fluorescent light. The floor in there is wet, though no one is in the showers. The water has pooled around the drain and refuses to leave. It looks like the floor is sweating.

Marta is already there, mop in hand, eyes narrowed at the water as if it is personally insulting her.

"You back from dead," she says without looking at me.

"You never get a day off?" I ask.

She shakes her head like the question is stupid. "Party never sleep. Dirt never sleep. Marta never sleep." She pushes the mop toward the drain, the water sliding reluctantly, like it knows it will be back in an hour.

I step to the sink and splash cold water on my face. The tap sputters and coughs. The water smells like pipes and metal, a little like pennies. I brush my teeth with the cheapest toothpaste known to man, the taste a minty burn that makes my eyes water. In the mirror, my face looks like someone else's. Red eyes, faded bleach in my hair, stubble that doesn't know if it wants to be a beard. I look like a guy who is supposed to be having the best time of his life, and I feel like a guy who is borrowing his body for the day.

I glance at the showers. The second stall from the left, the one without tiles, has a dark patch near the drain. Mold, the soft green of something alive that should not be. The concrete is slick with last night's soap. The pipe sticks out at head height, capped but still pointed, like a finger. Someone has drawn a smiley face above it in marker. The smile is lopsided.

"How long that pipe been like that?" I ask, because asking a question is easier than asking the ones in my head.

Marta snorts. "Long time. Longer than my patience. They say fix. They say always fix. They never fix." She wrings out the mop, water splashing. "You don't hit head. You lucky." She looks at me for the first time, and her expression is flat, not mean, just tired.

"I'll be careful," I say, because that is what people say right before they are not.

She points the mop at me like a warning. "Wear thongs. No run. No stupid. You young, you think you immortal. You not." Then she goes back to mopping, her muttering a low, constant prayer.

I laugh because it's the only thing I can do with that, and because the laugh keeps my chest from tightening in a way I don't want. I back away from the showers and the pipe and the idea of being careful. I grab my things and leave the bathroom without turning on the shower, without letting the cold water touch my skin. I tell myself I'll do it later, when the floor is drier, when I'm less shaky, when I deserve it.

Downstairs, the bar is waking up. Kuba is behind the counter, leaning on his elbows, hair in the same messy flop it always has. The neon sign buzzes above him, blue light pulsing faintly like a heartbeat. He grins when he sees me.

"Brad the Lad returns from the grave." He slides a glass of water toward me. "Hydrate, then die later. That's the schedule."

"You're an angel," I say, and drink the water in three gulps. It sits like a cold stone in my stomach, but it also makes the room stop swaying as much.

He taps the counter. "We do Recovery Gospel today. You up?"

"Recovery Gospel?"

"Kuba invention," he says proudly. "Water, then beer, then bread. It is in Bible. You preach to newbies."

I should say no. I should say I'm tired, I'm ruined, I'm going to take a nap and call my mother and be a responsible adult for one afternoon. I smile instead. "I'm up."

Kuba claps his hands. "Legend. We get them at one. New arrivals. You show them how to survive."

"Survive," I repeat, tasting the word like it's a joke.

He pours himself a coffee that smells like burnt toast and regret. The bar is quiet except for the low hum of the fridge and the occasional groan from the chill room. The dog from the courtyard is asleep on the couch, paws twitching in a dream.

I take a piece of toast from the kitchen, cold and limp, and chew it slowly, letting it line my stomach. The kitchen smells like yesterday's goulash and today’s disinfectant. There is a whiteboard on the wall with the words DRINK WATER OR DIE still written in block letters. Someone has added a smiley face. It is not comforting.

I check my phone. I have a notification from my sister. I open it, because I'm brave for a second.

You alive?

Her text is two words and a thousand years. I stare at it. I want to type back a joke, a photo, some evidence that I am still me. My thumbs hover. My stomach twists. I put the phone face down on the bar.

"You alright, mate?" Kuba asks. His voice is casual but his eyes are not.

"Yeah," I say too fast. "Just hangover."

He nods, because that is what we both want the answer to be. He starts wiping down the bar, the cloth smearing sticky patches rather than cleaning them. I sip my water. It tastes like metal and something else, a hint of bleach. It is probably just my imagination.

At one, the new arrivals trickle down the stairs, eyes wide, backpacks bigger than their bodies. There are six of them, a mixed bag of excitement and fear. A Canadian couple with matching backpacks and matching optimism. Two British girls in oversized hoodies, looking like they slept on planes and prayers. A German guy with a moustache and a guidebook tucked under his arm like a shield. And an American kid with a baseball cap and the kind of skin that has never seen a hostel bathroom.

Kuba rings a bell he keeps for moments like this. "Welcome to Mad House Prague!" he shouts, arms wide. "Your home for the next nights. This is Brad the Lad, your unofficial tour guide. He knows everything because he never leaves."

They laugh, because they are supposed to. I stand up, raise my hand like I'm a teacher and they're my class.

"Alright, legends," I say. "House rules. No puking in dorms. If you have to, use the bucket. Bucket is life."

I point to the bucket by the stairs. It's clean right now, which is a miracle.

"Bar is here," I say, sweeping my arm. "Open basically always. We do happy hour, we do karaoke, we do family dinner on Wednesdays. If you can still stand, you're invited."

They laugh again. The American kid raises his hand. "Is the tap water safe?"

"Safer than the beer?" I say. "Hard to say. People drink both and mostly live. Mostly."

A couple of them laugh nervously. The German guy doesn't. He writes something in his guidebook.

"Upstairs you've got dorms, bathrooms, the chill room. Showers are..." I pause, looking for the right word. "Authentic. Wear flip-flops, don't run, you'll be right." I tap my own thongs as proof. "If the shower eats you, Marta won't be happy."

Marta appears in the hallway like she heard her name. She glares. The British girls giggle.

I show them the wall of polaroids, the shame board of photos from previous nights. I point to a picture of a guy asleep in the sink with a caption that says THIS IS WHY WE CAN'T HAVE NICE THINGS. The Canadian girl laughs and takes a photo of it. I point out the rage cage, the courtyard, the graffiti that says SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD in five different hands. The American kid nods like he's taking mental notes on how to become a story.

"Any questions?" I ask.

"Is it really as crazy as people say?" one of the British girls asks, looking at Kuba like he's Santa.

Kuba winks. "Crazier," he says.

The group cheers, because that is what they came for. I feel a small twist in my stomach that isn't hunger. It is something else. I ignore it.

I take them out to the courtyard and show them the fairy lights, the smoking corner, the fountain that hasn't been clean since 2003. The air is cold and smells like wet stone. The clouds are low and heavy like they might fall.

"You all doing the pub crawl tonight?" I ask.

They all nod except the German guy, who says he is here for architecture. I clap him on the shoulder. "You'll end up at the bar anyway. Architecture can't compete with 20-crown beers." He smiles reluctantly.

I feel useful, which is a nice thing to feel. It makes me forget the hollow in my chest for a while. I give them my best tips, like where to get trdelnik, how to avoid the strip club scams, which kebab shop is least likely to give you food poisoning. They listen like I'm a prophet because I have been here for two weeks, which might as well be a lifetime in hostel time.

When they disperse, I slump onto a bar stool. Kuba slides a beer toward me like a reward.

"Preaching makes thirsty," he says.

"Amen," I say, and take a sip. It is cold and golden and tastes like nothing and everything at once. My body relaxes into it. My mind quiets a little. The hollowness becomes a hum.

---

By late afternoon the rain starts again, a soft, patient drizzle that turns the cobblestones outside into mirrors. The bar fills with the people who didn't go to the castle, which is most of them. Someone starts a drinking game with dice, another starts a playlist of songs that all sound like the inside of a nightclub. The air thickens with beer and perfume and sweat. The room begins to glow, not with light, but with heat.

I end up at the beer pong table, because the table is where I always end up. There is a beautiful simplicity to it: cup, ball, drink. Miss, drink. Hit, drink. It is a religion with rules I already know. The American kid from earlier is on my team, his cap turned backward like he's in a movie. He is terrible, which means he is impressive because he still thinks he's good.

"You're up," I tell him.

He throws, the ball hits the rim and bounces off. He groans. I clap him on the shoulder. "All good, mate. More practice." He downs his cup with a face like he's being punished. The Germans at the other end laugh. I laugh too. It feels easy. It feels like the only thing I'm good at right now.

Between games, I go to the kitchen and make a sandwich out of two slices of bread and whatever looks least likely to kill me. There is a container of something green that might be pesto or might be a science experiment. I decide on plain butter. The bread is stale. It still helps.

Liv shows up mid-afternoon, hair tied up, eyes less red than usual. She has a bruise on her arm and a story about a tram that she tells three times to three different people. She sees me and smiles like it's a relief. I feel that warm twist in my chest again, the good kind. She sits at the bar next to me and orders a cider.

"Quiet night?" she asks.

"It's four o'clock," I say.

"So?" She lifts her glass. "To recovery."

"To pretending," I say, and clink hers. The cider is sweet, mine is bitter, and together they taste like the kind of optimism you can afford at a bar.

She tells me she's thinking about extending her stay. I tell her everyone does, and that the hostel should have loyalty cards. She laughs. We talk about nothing, which is the best kind of conversation when your brain feels bruised.

At some point, the German guy from the morning wanders over and asks in a serious voice if the showers are always in such "states." He says the word like it is a war crime. I shrug.

"It's a party hostel," I say. "You want marble, you go to a hotel." I regret the words the second I say them, because I know what the showers look like, because I saw the pipe this morning and the dark mold patch like a bruise on the floor. But he just nods and walks away, notebook under his arm like a judge.

Kuba appears with a stack of shot glasses. "Power hour," he announces, as if it's a national holiday. The room cheers.

"I should probably take it easy," I say, mostly to myself.

Liv raises an eyebrow. "You?"

"Yeah," I say, but my hand is already reaching for a glass. The shot tastes like gasoline and pears. It burns, then turns warm. My body relaxes, my thoughts blur, my skin feels like it's been turned down from too loud to just right.

The rain outside turns into sleet, tiny pellets tapping against the windows. Someone suggests going to the pub crawl anyway because the cold makes the beer taste better, which might be true or might just be another myth we tell ourselves. I don't go. I tell myself it's because I'm being responsible. I tell myself it's because I'm tired. I tell myself it's because I want a quiet night. Then Kuba puts on a song I love and the bar becomes a party anyway, and my excuses dissolve like sugar in whiskey.

We dance between the bar tables, sloppy and uncoordinated. Someone spills a drink on my shorts. I laugh. Someone else takes a photo of me mid-shout and says they're putting it on the shame board. I pose for it, arms wide, teeth bared. I am a cartoon of myself and people love cartoons.

At one point, I step outside to the courtyard for air. The cold hits my face like a slap. The rain has stopped, but the stone is wet and shining. The fairy lights make the courtyard look like it is underwater. I lean against the wall and breathe, letting the cold cut through the fog in my head.

The American kid comes out too, cigarette in his hand, looking like he's never smoked before but wants to look like he has. He offers me one. I take it even though I don't want it because it's something to do with my hands.

"You ever get bored of this?" he asks, blowing smoke badly.

I laugh. "Bored? Mate, there's always something."

"But like..." He looks up at the lights. "Do you ever want to stop?"

The question lands heavier than he means it to. I should make a joke, something about stopping when I'm dead, something to keep the mood light. Instead I stare at the wet stones and think about my sister's text and my mum's missed calls. I think about my head sloshing this morning. I think about the pipe in the shower.

"Maybe later," I say. It is the most honest answer I have.

He nods like that makes sense, flicks his cigarette into the courtyard drain, and goes back inside. I watch the cigarette butt rest in the water, a small orange eye that dims and dies.

My phone buzzes again. I take it out. Another message from my sister.

Seriously. Call me.

I stare at it, fingers hovering. The air is cold and clean. I could call her right here. I could step away from the bar, away from the noise, and use this moment like a lifeline. I open the phone app. My thumb hovers over her name. I hear the music inside, the bass thumping through the stone. I think about walking back in, about being a legend, about not wanting to be a problem.

I lock the phone and put it back in my pocket.

"Later," I tell the cold air.

---

By midnight the bar is a living organism, sweaty and loud. The room moves in waves. The playlist is nothing but bangers. People are chanting someone's name again, and I catch mine in the middle of it, like a hook. I lift my cup and grin. The cheer is a drug that is cheaper than anything I've ever bought.

I lose track of time, which is easy when time is measured in shots. I play a round of Rage Cage and get elbowed in the ribs, a sharp pain that makes me laugh too loud. I dance with Liv and spin her until she almost falls. I catch her and she looks up at me, laughing, face flushed. For a second, I want to tell her something important, like that this is nice, that she's nice, that I don't want to ruin this. Instead I shout, "Another round!" because it's easier.

At one, the chill room is full of people sleeping in unnatural poses. At two, the couch is a pile of limbs. At three, the bar is mostly survivors and staff. Kuba's eyes are red but he is still moving, still smiling like it's the only muscle he ever trained.

I go upstairs to pee and the hallway is empty and echoing. The light flickers like it's deciding whether to die. The wet floor sign is leaning against the wall again, the same one, the same joke. The drip from the ceiling is still counting time. Plink. Plink. Plink. It is the only steady rhythm in a building that never stops.

In the bathroom, the sink is clogged with someone's hair. The mirror is fogged. The floor is wet and cold under my flip-flops. I look into the showers without meaning to. The second stall is open, the curtain stuck to itself like a damp flag. The pipe catches the light, copper and blunt. There is a towel on the floor that shouldn't be there. A faint smell of blood hangs in the damp air, probably from someone who nicked themselves shaving, probably nothing. I breathe through my mouth.

"Don't be weird," I tell myself, and use the toilet.

When I wash my hands, the water is icy and the faucet squeals. I look at my face in the mirror and don't recognize the guy staring back. His eyes are too old. His smile is too practiced. There is a small cut on his lip that wasn't there earlier. Maybe it was, maybe it wasn't. The nights here blend together like spills on the bar.

I go back downstairs because the music is still calling. The bar is a different world than the hallway. It is warm and bright and loud, a place where you can forget your name and remember it at the same time. I take another drink. I probably shouldn't. I do anyway.

At some point, I end up on the stairs with my head in my hands. Liv sits next to me, her knees pulled up, her face pale under the red light. She offers me a piece of gum. I take it. The mint is sharp and makes my eyes water.

"You okay?" she asks.

"Yeah," I say, because that is my script. "Just tired."

She looks at me like she wants to push, like she wants to say something deeper, but then she shrugs. "I'm done," she says. "Can't do another.

"Me neither," I lie.

We go upstairs together and split at the dorm door. She sleeps in a different room. I watch her walk away, then keep going. The hallway is colder up here, the air damp. My flip-flops slap the tile. My towel is still around my neck, a damp leash.

In the dorm, the guy in the bunk across from me is still asleep, still snoring. The room smells like sweat and stale beer. Someone has left the window cracked and the cold seeps in. I sit on my bunk and pull my phone out again. I stare at my sister's name until the screen dims. I don't call.

I lie back and listen to the building. The pipes tick. A door opens and closes somewhere down the hall. A shower turns on, just a faint rush at first, then the full roar. It is a sound that has become part of the building's heartbeat. It is also a sound that makes the hair on my arms lift, a small warning I don't understand.

I close my eyes and imagine the water on my face, cold then warm. I imagine the sting on my skin, the rinse, the clean. I imagine stepping into the second stall, the one with the missing tiles, the one with the pipe. I imagine it without the pipe because that's easier. I tell myself I'll shower in the morning, properly, like a person who isn't falling apart.

The shower runs for a long time, then stops. The silence that follows is thick. I can hear my own breathing, slow and heavy. I can hear the drip in the hallway, the relentless clock.

I tell myself I'm fine. I tell myself I have tomorrow. I tell myself the water will wash it off.

The room sways, the hostel breathes, and somewhere in the dark the bathroom waits.
