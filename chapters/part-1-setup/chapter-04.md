# Chapter 04: The Morning After Is a Lie

The first thing I taste is last night.

It is stuck in the back of my throat like a dare I already lost. Vodka, warm beer, that weird licorice burn from the absinthe shot Kuba poured with a grin like a cartoon villain. My tongue is a carpet. My head is a drum kit. The room smells like damp clothes, body spray, and the bucket by the door that someone missed by an inch. I blink and the ceiling tilts, the slanted white lines of the bunk above me swimming like fish.

My phone says 10:12. That is not a time so much as a warning. My hand is shaking when I pick it up. The screen is too bright. The last thing I posted is a shaky video of me yelling at the camera, my eyes red-filtered into cartoon demon eyes, the caption DAY 14 IN PRAGUE STILL GOING STRONG. There are laughing emojis, the kind that pretend they are laughter but really just mean I see you. I swallow, and it hurts.

Someone groans on the top bunk. The guy across from me—tall, German, flip-flops on even in bed—rolls over and knocks his water bottle to the floor. It thuds, a small funeral for hydration. I sit up slowly. The plastic mattress protector peels away from my back with a sound like tape. My stomach flips. I breathe through my nose and tell myself to stand. Standing is the first test. I fail the first time.

I put my feet on the cold floor and feel the world tilt. The floor is sticky, a constellation of old beer and new regret. There is a bruise on my thigh, a dark blue smear the size of my palm. I do not remember it. I poke it anyway. It hurts in the clean way pain does when it is not attached to memory. I tell myself I probably slammed into a table or a railing or a friendly wall that decided to be less friendly. It is fine. It is always fine.

The guy in flip-flops—Klaus, I think, though I might be confusing him with another tall German I drank with—mumbles something that sounds like, "Mate, are you alive?" I answer with a thumbs up. My throat does not do words yet.

I swing my legs out and sit on the edge of the bunk. The room is a wet zoo of bodies. Someone is snoring with conviction. Someone is whispering into their phone in a language that sounds like music. The air is cold at the feet and hot at the head, because the radiator is blasting like it is trying to kill mold with heat. The window is open a crack to let in the March cold. It smells like wet stone and cigarette smoke. The hostel is already waking, a low growl of movement in the hallway.

My phone buzzes with a message from Mum. "You okay? Haven't heard from you. Love you." It sits there on the screen like a hand on my shoulder. I stare at it, then lock the phone. My brain puts it in a folder labeled Later, which is where I put everything that hurts.

I need the toilet. I need water. I need to scrub the taste of Prague nights out of my skin. I need a shower.

The idea of the shower is a bright thing in my fog. Cold water, then hot, then cold again. The slap of it on my head. The way it makes the world simpler for a few minutes. The way I can pretend I am rinsing away more than sweat and stale beer. The shower is a reset button. That is the lie it tells. I believe it anyway.

I stand slowly, steadying myself on the bunk frame. The metal is cold. My hand is sweating. I pull on my board shorts, the same ones I wore last night. They are damp in the crotch, which is as gross as it sounds. I do not care. I grab my towel from the hook and it smells like beer, too. I drape it over my shoulder like a flag of surrender.

The hallway is bright in a way that is cruel. The overhead light flickers, then settles. There is a mop bucket by the stairs, a yellow sign that says CAUTION WET FLOOR in English and in Czech. A thin ribbon of water runs along the edge of the tiles, shining in the light like a trail for insects. The smell of bleach is heavy, trying to overpower the mildew. It loses.

Marta is down on her knees with a rag, muttering in Czech at a puddle that is winning. She looks up when I pass, her mouth pressed into a line that could be a smile in another universe.

"Morning," I say, because I am polite even when I am dying.

She snorts. "Morning. You party, yes?" Her English is clean and sharp, like a blade she learned to carry.

"Always," I say, because it is the role. Because it is easier than telling the truth.

She wipes her hands on her jeans and glances toward the bathroom. "Be careful. Floor is..." She searches for the word. "Tricky. Slippery. Dangerous." The way she says it makes it sound like the floor is a person who will steal your wallet.

"Yeah, yeah," I say, and give her the same grin I give everyone. The grin that says I am made of rubber. The grin that lies.

The bathroom door is open. The air inside is warmer, damp from showers running all night. It smells like cheap soap and a wet dog and something coppery. The sinks are lined with toiletries: bottles of shampoo, a toothbrush, a razor perched on the edge like a tiny guillotine. I step inside and feel the tile under my feet, slick and cold.

Then I freeze.

In the mirror, I catch myself. I look worse than I feel, which is saying something. My eyes are bloodshot and the red filter on my last Instagram story did not do them justice. My hair is a mess of bleached spikes and sweat. There is a faint mark across my cheek from sleeping on my arm. I look like someone who fell asleep at a party and woke up at an airport.

I glance at the shower stalls. Three square mouths, three curtains hanging half on. The middle stall has a curtain that is torn along the bottom. The second from the left—the one I almost went into at four—has a pipe sticking out like a tooth. The flickering light makes it glint. It is just a pipe. It is just plumbing. It is not a threat. I tell myself this three times.

My stomach rolls. I am not ready for the shower yet. I need water first. Food. A reset before the reset. I turn around and head back down the hall.

The courtyard is open to the sky, a pale square of morning that looks too honest for this place. The stone is wet from the night, slick underfoot. The fountain coughs, a weak stream splashing into a basin full of leaves and cigarette butts. The dog is there, tail thumping once on the concrete, then stopping like it remembered it has dignity. I breathe in and the air tastes like rain and stale beer. Somewhere down the street a tram squeals. A sparrow lands on the railing and pecks at something that might be bread or might be regret.

I stand there a minute with my towel over my shoulder, letting the cold slap my face. The chill makes my head feel clearer for a half second, a tiny reset. The building wraps around the courtyard like a jaw. There is graffiti on every wall, layers of marker and paint and stickers. Someone has drawn a smiley face with Xs for eyes. Someone else has written, in shaky English, WELCOME TO THE AFTER. It is supposed to be funny. It is funny. It is also true.

On the far side, a couple of new arrivals are taking photos of the fountain. They are clean in the way people are clean before the hostel gets to them. One of them glances at me and smiles the nervous smile of someone who doesn't know if they should say hello. I lift my glassless hand in a wave. They wave back and go back to their phones.

I wonder, for a second, what I would look like in their photos if they turned the camera. Not as a legend. Just as a hungover bloke in damp shorts, staring at a fountain like it might answer questions. The thought makes me laugh. It is a dry laugh. It hurts.

I go back inside because the cold is honest and I am not.

In the common room, the morning is a different kind of chaos. The bar is half-lit, the neon sign still buzzing even though it is morning. The couch is littered with sleeping bodies, limbs at angles that look wrong. Someone is playing quiet music from a phone, the beat slow and heavy like a heart trying to remember its own rhythm. The dog is awake, nose in a backpack, a professional scavenger.

Kuba is behind the bar, wiping down a counter that will never be truly clean. He looks up and grins. His hair is a mess of curls and his t-shirt says DRINK LIKE A LOCAL with a cartoon of a beer mug. He has been here as long as I have, which means two weeks, which in hostel time is a decade.

"Brad the Lad lives," he says.

"Barely," I say. My voice is sand. "Any water?"

He slides a glass across the counter. "Here. And you should eat. You look like a corpse, mate. It's inspiring."

"Cheers," I say, and drink it in one go. The water is warm, but it hits my stomach like a lifeline. I pull a face and he laughs.

The bar top is sticky. A bowl of stale cereal sits out for breakfast, untouched. Someone has made toast in the kitchen and burnt it, and now the smell of charcoal fills the room. A couple of fresh-faced arrivals are standing near the polaroid wall, eyes wide. Their backpacks are clean. Their skin is not yet tired. I recognize that look. It is the look of someone who still believes the party is a story and not a job.

A girl with a bun and a bright jacket looks at the bar, then at me. "Is this the place?" she asks, in an accent that could be Canadian or British, which are basically the same at this hour.

"This is it," I say. "Mad House. You made it."

She smiles. "We just got in. Any tips?"

I should tell her to sleep. To drink water. To buy flip-flops for the shower. Instead I say the things I always say. "Bar opens at noon. Free beer pong at seven. If you want the rage cage, ask Kuba. And don't leave your charger out unless you want it to walk away."

Her friend laughs. "What about the bathrooms?"

I shrug. "Dodgy as, but you'll survive. Just go slow when you're pissed." I wink because that makes it a joke. Her laugh is a little too high. She does not hear the warning inside the words.

On the couch, a guy sits up and rubs his eyes. He has shower flip-flops on, rubber as a promise. He catches me looking and lifts his foot in salute. "Always, man," he says. "My feet never touch hostel floors."

"You're soft," I tell him.

"I'm alive," he says.

We both laugh. It is easier than thinking.

Kuba puts a hand on my shoulder. "You staying for family dinner tonight?"

"Maybe," I say. "Depends if I'm dead."

He gives me a look that could be concern if he had the time for it. He doesn't. He is already turning to another guest who wants a coffee. Coffee is three euros and tastes like burnt rubber. People drink it anyway.

I pour myself another glass of water and stare at the wall of polaroids. There is one of me from last week, arm around a British guy, both of us grinning like we just robbed a bank. We probably did, in a way. Time, energy, small pieces of our futures. The photos are all the same: people with red eyes and beer in hand, the neon bar sign glowing in the background. The wall is proof that this place eats time and spits out evidence.

I think about the other wall back home, the one in Mum's kitchen, where she pinned a photo of me in my apprentice uniform when I first started. I looked clean in that photo. I looked like someone who finished what he started. The uniform was too big. The smile was too small. My boss said I had good hands. He also said I drank too much. I laughed and told him it was just weekends. He told me it wasn't. The day he said it, I quit. The next day I booked a flight. The day after that I told Mum it was for travel, for experience, for finding myself. She cried, which felt like blame even when it wasn't.

If I'm honest, I did not find myself. I found bars. I found people who laughed at the same jokes. I found a way to be liked without being known. Every hostel has the same rhythm: arrive, drink, become a nickname, repeat. It is simple. It is easier than thinking about who you are when the music stops. The problem is the music never stops here. Or if it does, it only stops long enough to puke and start again.

The water in my glass is empty again. I do not remember drinking it. That is a skill you learn by accident. I refill it, drink slower. It still goes too fast.

The dog sits by my feet and looks up, eyes pleading. I give it a corner of toast. It sniffs, then takes it with the careful politeness of an animal that has learned what hands can do.

I should shower now. That is the plan. Shower, then toast, then hair of the dog. The routine. The routine is how I keep the panic quiet. I finish the water. I stand. The room tilts. I sit back down.

"You good?" Kuba asks.

"Just a spin," I say. "Hangover doing laps."

He nods. "Shower helps. And maybe not drinking for an hour."

I laugh, because the thought of not drinking for an hour is so ridiculous it feels like a dare. "Yeah, right." I stand again, this time keeping one hand on the bar until my body catches up. My legs feel like they are filled with wet sand.

In the kitchen, the toast is turning black. Someone has left a pan on the burner, a slow burn of eggs and oil. I pour myself a coffee anyway, because my body expects the ritual. The coffee is thin, bitter, the kind of drink that makes your stomach wobble. I take one sip and put it down. The smell of burnt toast makes me gag. I lean on the counter and breathe, slow. The sink is full of beer cans and a plastic plate with a bite taken out of it. A sign above the sink says WASH YOUR S***, THIS IS NOT YOUR MUM. I laugh again. The kitchen smells like old grease and new mornings.

I grab a banana from the basket and peel it. The banana is soft, bruised, perfect for a hangover. I take a bite and it tastes like effort. I chew anyway. Behind me, a girl with a septum ring is pouring vodka into her coffee. She notices me watching and shrugs. "Breakfast," she says. I nod. That is fair. That is normal here. That is the problem.

I finish half the banana and toss the rest. It lands in the bin like a perfect shot. I should feel proud. I feel nauseous. The room is too bright. The chatter is too loud. I want the shower again, the white noise of water, the pretense of cleanliness.

The staircase to the dorm floors is a narrow tunnel. The banister is worn smooth by a thousand sweaty hands. I grip it as I climb. On the landing, a group of Brits are sitting on the steps with cans of beer, already on their recovery. One of them raises a can to me. "Legend," he says.

"Let's go," I say, because it is my brand. I take a sip off his can without asking. It is warm. It tastes like effort. My body relaxes around it anyway. The first mouthful of beer is a small surrender. It smooths the edge of my headache. It makes me feel like me.

I give the can back and keep walking. The hallway on the third floor is still damp. The mop bucket is now in the corner and the water trail has spread. Someone has walked through it and left a series of wet footprints toward the bathrooms, small and fast like a child running away. The air is cold. The building hums. The pipes click.

My body feels like a rental car I keep taking off-road. It rattles, it complains, and I keep turning up the radio. When I was sixteen, I used to pride myself on how much I could drink and still surf the next morning. The ocean was the test. The hangover was just another wave to ride. Now the test is getting out of bed without the room tipping. I tell myself it is fine. I tell myself everyone feels like this at twenty-two. I tell myself thirty is a long way away. I tell myself a lot of things.

The bruise on my thigh throbs as I walk. I press my palm against it out of habit, like I can make it stop by touching it. The gesture makes me think of my mum pressing her hand to my forehead when I was sick, checking for fever. She would call me "her big boy" and I would roll my eyes and secretly love it. I have not been home in months. My life fits in a backpack. That is supposed to feel free. Sometimes it feels like being homeless with better shoes.

There is a poster on the wall by the bathrooms: a cartoon of a skeleton in a shower, the caption TAKE YOUR SHOWER SHOES. I laugh, and the laugh turns into a cough. The hallway smells like damp concrete and cheap deodorant. The building is full of water it cannot get rid of. It runs along the floor, creeps into the corners, makes the air taste green. I know this. I feel it in the way my feet stick for a second before they lift. The floor is trying to keep me. I check my phone again without thinking. Another message from Mum, a follow-up: \"All good?\" There is a missed call from my sister. I stare at the screen until it dims. The hallway hums. The pipes click. I put the phone back in my pocket like I am putting away a small guilt.

Outside the bathroom, I pause. There is a new sign on the door that says PLEASE DO NOT LEAVE HAIR IN THE DRAINS. Someone has drawn a skull on it. I push the door open with my shoulder. The light flickers. The air is warm and damp and alive. The floor is slick, a sheen of water over concrete and tile. I can see the mold in the corners, black and green like bruises on the walls.

The flip-flop guy from the couch is at the sink, brushing his teeth. He looks at me in the mirror. "You going in?" he asks, mouth full of foam.

"Yeah," I say, and then I don't.

I stand there and look at the shower stalls. The second stall's pipe glints again, and now I can see the rust around it, a halo of orange. The tiles around it are gone, exposing concrete that looks like bone. There is a puddle in the corner, a slow pool that doesn't drain. The water here doesn't move unless you move it.

The room tilts again. The beer I stole off the stairs is sitting in my stomach, warming like a small fire. I swallow. The shower is a few steps away. The idea of it is clean. The reality of it is this room.

I am not scared. I refuse to be scared. I am just cautious. There is a difference. I take a step forward and the floor is slick under my foot. My toe skids, a tiny betrayal. I catch myself on the sink. The flip-flop guy laughs.

"See?" he says around his toothbrush. "Floor is a bastard."

"All good," I say, even though my heart jumps. I take my foot back. I stand there, towel over my shoulder, and I tell myself I should go back for my own flip-flops. I tell myself I should wait until the floor dries. I tell myself I should just get it over with.

The water in the pipes shivers, a low groan that runs through the wall. It is like the building is clearing its throat. I look up at the fluorescent light, the way it buzzes. I look back at the pipe. I imagine the water hitting my head, the way it would jolt me awake. I imagine the relief of being clean, of pretending I have pressed reset.

I take a step back instead. "I'm gonna grab my flops," I say, because it sounds responsible. It sounds like someone who has a plan. It sounds like a different person.

"Good luck finding them," the guy says. "Hostel floor eats everything."

I smile and back out of the bathroom. The hallway is empty. The mop bucket is still there, the caution sign leaning against the wall like it gave up. My towel is heavy on my shoulder. My head is heavy in my skull. I walk back toward the dorm, toward my bunk, toward the mess I left. The shower waits behind me, its mouth open, its pipe glinting, its floor slick and hungry.

By the time I reach the dorm, my phone is buzzing again. A notification from Instagram: three people replied to my story. One of them is my sister, sending the eye-roll emoji. I grin. I tell myself I'll reply after I shower. After I feel human. After I have a beer. After the party starts again.

I sit on the edge of my bunk and stare at my flip-flops, kicked under the bed like they are ashamed. I should put them on. I should go back. I should do the sensible thing. I can hear the drip in the hall, steady as a metronome. Drip. Drip. Drip. The hostel is waking up, but the bathroom is still waiting. The water is still running for someone else, somewhere down the hall. The pipes are clearing their throat.

I tie my towel tighter around my waist and stand. The room tilts, then steadies. I hold the flip-flops in my hand, warm from the floor. I walk toward the door. This is a small choice. It does not feel like one. It feels like routine. It feels like the only way forward.

Behind me, the guy on the top bunk mutters, "Sleep when you're dead." I laugh, because that is my line. Because hearing it from someone else makes it sound like a joke again.

I step into the hallway. The light flickers. The caution sign is still there. The floor is still wet. The bathroom door is open like a mouth that never closes.

The shower is a promise. The morning is a lie. I walk toward both.
