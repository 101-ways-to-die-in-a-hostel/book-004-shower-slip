# Chapter 01: The Cleanest Dirt

I almost died in a shower I had not even checked into yet.

That is the kind of thing you only learn to say after it is almost true. In the moment it is just a squeal of rubber, a blur of white tile, and the sharp metallic taste you get right before your teeth clap together. The sound my body made was humiliating, a seal clapping for a show that had not started. I grabbed the doorframe, the rough paint catching my palm, and hung there with my bag still on my back like a turtle hung upside down.

It was not a dramatic slip. It was the kind of slip you can dismiss with a joke, which is its own trap. I laughed, loud, because there were people behind me and because I have always believed that if I said the funniest thing first, the universe would forget it meant me harm.

"Welcome to La Cardenal," the receptionist said, not looking up. Her nails were a chipped sea-green. The bell on the counter was a small skull with wings. She pressed a sticker onto a form and slid it back to me. "Mind the wet floor. The cleaners use too much product. Shoes off in the bathrooms. Rules on the door."

I nodded like I was listening, still holding the doorframe. The floor looked clean in the way that grocery store produce looks clean, a shine you can taste that does not belong to the thing itself. I set my bag down, took a photo of the lobby for my story, and called it a soft landing. The caption wrote itself in my head: *Checked into a monastery turned hostel. Smells like lemon and last night's regrets.*

My name is Callum, which is a name that sounds better in email than it does when you say it at a bar. I am twenty-seven. I have a job that is a sentence: I am a remote UX consultant who pivoted into travel content. That sentence is the stair I climb; I know every wobble. I work during the day, I take golden hour pictures of my coffee at four, and I tell myself this is not an escape from anything, just a longer commute.

La Cardenal sits on a narrow street in San Miguel de la Sal, a coastal city that tastes like rust when the wind changes. The hostel is a converted convent or a converted bathhouse depending on which review you believe. Either way, the building is old enough to have opinions about the weather. It sighs when the sea rises. It sweats in the afternoon. It smells like lime disinfectant, wet stone, and the long ghost of incense.

My dorm is on the second floor. The staircase is chipped wood that bends as you climb. The walls are tiled in faded blue, geometric patterns gone soft at the edges like they are melting. Somebody painted over a mural of saints and fish. There is a water stain shaped like a map. I take a photo of it too. The dorm door is open, fan churning the air like a slow blender. There are six bunks, five people. A woman with a sheet mask stares at me from the top bunk, a tiny white ghost. A guy with a tattoo of a barcode on his wrist waves without looking up from his phone.

My bed is the bottom bunk by the window. The mattress is thin and the sheet smells like bleach and someone else’s shampoo. I drop my bag, take a careful look around, and tell myself to be grateful. La Cardenal has been rated a 9.2 on a website that measures life by the angle of its overhead lighting. The photos showed a courtyard with a fountain. The reviews said the showers were incredible.

This is how you know a review was written by someone who has never needed to bend their knee on slippery tile.

I unpack my life in a backpack. It does not take long. I pin my passport into the locker, lock it with the highest rated combination lock on the internet, and hang my towel in a way that makes it look like I belong. I pull out my camera and do a quick sweep of the room. If I cannot monetize the experience, it is just a bad decision.

In the mirror above the sink I look like I always look: moderately attractive in a way that makes you think I am polite, shorter than I want, freckles on my nose that make me look earnest. I have a funny scar at the base of my thumb, a souvenir from the time I decided to learn to cook using a knife set I could not afford. My hair is still damp from the bus ride. It does the thing it always does when there is humidity, which is to become a separate animal that refuses to be tamed.

If my fatal flaw had to be a word on a checklist, it would be control. I like to act like I am winging it. I am not. I measure my day in twenty-minute blocks. I track my macros. I have backup chargers for my backup chargers. I sleep with earplugs and a silk eye mask and a low-level anxiety that the hostel will run out of hot water.

The bathroom is down the hall, behind a door marked with an icon of a showerhead that looks like an octopus. The floor outside is dry. The floor inside is glossy and slightly sloped, like a stage. There are three stalls, each with a vinyl curtain that tries to cling to you like a wet hand. The walls are tiled in the same faded blue, but in here they have a different mood. Everything echoes. The drain is a rusted coin-size circle in the center of each stall, its teeth open.

I stand there, gripping my towel, remembering my near slip at the lobby. My foot tests the tile. It is smooth, almost silky, and my toes curl to keep from sliding. Someone has etched a tiny line in one tile, a little cross. Maybe it is a scratch, maybe a mark, maybe a warning. I decide it is nothing, because that is what people like me do. We decide it is nothing to keep the story moving.

Back in the dorm, the woman with the sheet mask peels it off and looks straight at me. "First time here?"

"Yeah," I say. "Just got in. Smells like a spa and a ghost."

She laughs. "You will get used to it. The water is moody."

"Moody how?"

She shrugs. "Hot. Then cold. Then hot. It is like a person who does not know what they want."

"I can handle it," I say, which is almost always a lie.

She introduces herself as Marisol. She is from Buenos Aires, here to take photos of doors, which is a genre of travel I can respect. The guy with the barcode tattoo is named Jin and is here for three days, which means he is not here for anything but sleep. A couple in matching linen outfits say hello and then immediately become a single organism again. There is a Canadian who does not speak until he says, "If you want hot water, go early. The pipes are like old men."

I take this in, file it under tips I will not follow.

The common room is downstairs, past the kitchen that smells like garlic and burnt toast. There is a wall of books with a neon sign that says STAY WOKE, which feels too on the nose. The courtyard is beyond it, a square of pale sun and overwatered plants. A fountain coughs into a cracked basin. Someone has hung hammocks between pillars. There is a dog sleeping with its tongue out, a pure act of trust.

I set up at a table with my laptop, order a coffee from the tiny bar, and open my email. I have a client in Zurich who wants their onboarding flow to feel "light, but still authoritative." I close the email. I should be working. I am in a hostel. There are six new messages about delays in their app. I answer them anyway, the way you answer your mother even when you are late to dinner.

When the Wi-Fi drops for a minute, I consider it an insult. I walk to the router like a pilgrim, holding my laptop as if it might catch the signal by proximity. The router is taped to the wall with gaffer tape, its lights blinking like a tiny emergency. The password is written on a chalkboard in the kitchen, next to a list of rules about dishes and a note that says PLEASE DO NOT CRY IN THE FRIDGE. I reset the connection and rejoin a video call with a face that tries to say relaxed. My background is a blank wall. I sit with my back to the courtyard so they cannot see the dog asleep in the sun and the shirtless Australian doing handstands. In my headphones, the project manager says, "We really need this by end of day," as if time zones are optional. I say, "Totally," and pretend the noise of the fountain is my white-noise machine.

My fatal flaw is that I believe I can outwork anything. A bad hostel. A bad relationship. A failing app. I can smooth it all with the right interface, the right routine. I take a sip of coffee, too bitter, and tell myself to breathe. The coffee tastes like burnt citrus. It makes me feel productive in the way that placebo pills make you feel cured.

While I work, I listen. A group of Australians are trying to plan a day trip to the salt flats without googling. A French guy is explaining to a German guy that the city is named after salt because the fishermen used to trade it for something. A staff member sweeps without looking where the broom is going. A light bulb buzzes above the kitchen with the persistence of a low-grade threat.

The barista is a tall woman with a shaved head and a star tattooed behind her ear. She slides me a tiny cup. "First day?"

"Is it obvious?"

She smiles. "You still have your wallet on the table. Regulars hide it in their socks."

"Good tip," I say, and tuck my wallet into my bag. I am the kind of person who takes the advice you can act on immediately.

She leans on the counter. "The showers are being weird. If you hear them groaning, do not be in there."

"They groan?" I ask.

"Old pipes. If it makes a sound like a whale, get out."

I laugh. "You are messing with me."

She taps the counter twice, a tiny rhythm. "I never mess with showers."

Her name is Luz, and she smells like coffee and cigarette smoke. She has the kind of expression that says she has seen many new people arrive and most of them leave with all their limbs. There is a scar on her forearm that she does not bother to hide. The tattoo behind her ear is a star that could be a compass or a warning.

"Do you live here?" I ask.

She snorts. "Nobody lives here. We just stay a long time."

It is a good line. I put it in my notes.

By late afternoon, the light turns the courtyard into a stage. I take photos, do a set of push-ups by the fountain because I am that guy, and then video myself talking about minimalism while sitting on a hammock. A little boy runs through the courtyard chasing the dog. The dog looks like it used to be someone's pet and then decided to be a citizen. I give it a piece of bread and it ignores me. I am used to that.

When you travel long enough, your body becomes a calendar. Mine says it is time for a shower. The bus ride left a film of grime on my skin, a mix of diesel and sweat. The air is humid and I can feel it sticking to the back of my knees. I want the ritual: the steam, the heat, the brief privacy in a room with a lock. I want to be alone with running water and my own thoughts, which are always worse when they are dry.

In the dorm, I grab my toiletries and my towel. Marisol is reading on her bunk. "Bathroom is empty," she says without looking up. "But it just did the whale thing."

"Whale thing?"

"Like a groan. The pipes. It is probably fine."

I nod like I am brave. In truth, I do not believe in warnings unless there is a red light. I am not proud of this. It is the shape of my optimism.

The hallway is cooler than the dorm. The tile under my feet is cold, almost wet, or maybe my feet are hot. The bathroom door is ajar. The light inside flickers once, then steadies. I step in. The air is humid, smelling of eucalyptus soap and the sharp sting of bleach. The floor is slick. I see a few hairs clinging to the drain. A flip-flop lies on its side like a dead fish. I kick it toward the corner.

There is a sign taped above the sinks, a printed sheet with a clip-art showerhead. PLEASE USE SHOWER MATS. PLEASE REPORT LEAKS. PLEASE DO NOT WASH CLOTHES IN THE SINK. Below it, in pen, someone has added: PLEASE DO NOT DIE.

I laugh out loud. It sounds too big in the empty bathroom. I take a photo of the sign. That will do well on my feed.

I choose the middle stall because I am a middle-stall person. The curtain sticks to my hand as I pull it closed. I hang my towel on the hook, which is loose and wobbles when I touch it. I turn the faucet. The water sputters, coughs, then runs rusty for a second before clearing. I let it warm, the steam rising. The tiles begin to sweat. I step in, one foot at a time, because I am not an idiot.

The first touch of water is cold, then hot, then lukewarm. It behaves like a mood swing. I stand under it anyway, washing the grime off my arms, the grit out of my hair. The sound of the water makes a pocket of silence around me. It is loud enough that I do not hear the door open.

When I tilt my head back, I see the ceiling is cracked in a pattern that looks like a river delta. A small line of water runs down the wall, not from my shower but from somewhere above. There is a dark spot in the grout that looks like mold shaped into an eye. I blink. It does not change.

The water shifts again, turning hot enough to sting. I step to the side, one foot sliding just a little. My heart jumps. I grip the curtain, feel it rip a half inch, and steady myself. The pull leaves a wet thread on my fingers. I tell myself to move slower, to be careful. I am good at telling myself things and then letting the other parts of my body ignore it.

A groan comes from the pipes, low and long, like the building is stretching. The water temperature drops. I laugh, because Luz told me to get out, and because I am not the kind of person who lets a groan win. I have spent a life making powerpoints in rooms that smell like black coffee and sadness. I am not going to be chased out of a shower by a noise.

"Come on," I say to the faucet, as if it can be convinced. I flick the handle. The water surges, hotter now, pounding the back of my neck. I step forward, weight shifting, and my heel lands on something that is not tile.

It is a soap sliver, a cheap hotel bar melted into a translucent coin. My foot slips, smooth and fast. My arms flail, hand shooting out for the wall. The curtain yanks free. My knee knocks the edge of the faucet. The sound is a hard metal thunk, and then there is the world slanting, the ceiling spinning, the drain opening its mouth.

I catch the hook with my fingers. It bends. The whole shower rack groans. I hang for half a second, my body suspended, water hammering my back, and I see everything at once: the loose tiles, the wobbling hook, the crack in the ceiling, the slick floor. I see my reflection in the metal faucet, distorted, eyes wide and ridiculous.

The hook snaps.

I do not fall. I spin, slam into the wall, and land on my hands and knees. The pain in my palm is sharp and clean. My knee throbs. The curtain wraps around my shoulder like a shroud. The water is still running. The floor is still slick. The sound of the pipes is a second heartbeat.

I sit there, breathing, the adrenaline making my hands shake. Then I laugh again, because it is either that or cry, and because the moment is so dumb. I, Callum, the guy who reads five-star hostel reviews like gospel, nearly took myself out in a shower by stepping on a soap sliver.

I finish the shower quickly, carefully, with the smallest movements, like I am afraid to spook the water. I shut it off. The sudden quiet is enormous. I wrap myself in my towel and step onto the bath mat. It slides. I step back. I wait, then step forward again, holding the wall. The mat holds. I get dressed with the careful precision of a person who has just been reminded that they are not, in fact, the main character in a safe world.

When I open the stall, the bathroom is empty, but the air feels watched. The lights buzz. The drain gurgles. I stand at the sink, look in the mirror, and see a red mark blooming on my knee. I am fine. I am fine. I am fine.

On my way out, I notice something I missed earlier. A hairline crack runs across the tile by the drain, a line that is not quite straight, like a lightning bolt. There is dampness seeping from it, a slow darkening of the grout. I crouch to look, as if I am a detective, and the sound of water above deepens. Another groan. The tiles beneath my hand tremble, or maybe that is just my pulse. I stand up quickly and leave.

The hallway smells like laundry and bleach. My heart is still racing. I pass the dorm, where Marisol looks up and raises her eyebrows. I shrug like nothing happened, which is a lie.

Back in the common room, I order another coffee I do not need. Luz is there, polishing glasses that already shine. She sees my wet hair and nods toward the bathrooms. "Survived?"

"Barely," I say. "You were right about the whale."

"I am always right about the whale," she says. She looks at my knee. "You are bleeding."

"Just a scrape," I say. I hold my towel tighter around me. It is ridiculous to feel modest in a hostel common room, but I do.

She slides me a napkin. "Maybe use the mats."

"I did. It tried to take me anyway."

"The floors are old. They remember when this place was a bathhouse. Water carved grooves into the stone. When it dries, it feels like glass."

"Sounds romantic," I say.

"Nothing about this place is romantic."

I laugh, because I like her. I like the way her jokes land without trying. I tell her about my work, about how I am supposed to be finishing a design audit by tomorrow morning. She tells me about the sea, about how it comes in closer every year. "Sometimes the pipes taste like salt," she says. "That is when you know the tide is angry."

Her words are meant to be poetic. They make me think about the crack in the tile and the groan of the pipes. I shake it off. I am not afraid of a building. I am not afraid of water. I am just tired.

Later, when the courtyard is blue with dusk, I sit on the steps with a beer. I upload a few photos, write a caption about survival in the wild. I add a laughing emoji. People respond with fire and the word "legend." I feel the warm embarrassment of being perceived.

A man in a red shirt sits beside me. He smells like clove cigarettes. He introduces himself as Niko, says he is from Croatia, says he has been on the road for two years. "You new?" he asks, and his English is excellent in the way that makes my own language feel lazy.

"Just arrived," I say. "Almost died in the shower."

He laughs. "It is not the shower that kills you here."

"What is?"

He looks at the fountain, where the water is brown with leaves. "The stairs. The heat. The cheap rum. The stories you tell yourself."

"That is a lot of things."

"This place is a checklist," he says. "You tick enough boxes, something goes wrong."

I want to ask him what he means, but there is a group forming in the courtyard. A hostel tour, I guess, or a pub crawl. Someone blows a whistle. The dog wakes and shakes itself, spraying water from its fur. Niko stands. "You coming?" he asks.

"I have work," I say, like that means anything.

"Then you are already dead," he says, and walks away, laughter in his voice.

I am left with my beer and the sting of his words. I open my laptop and answer emails. I tell my client that the onboarding flow will feel light and authoritative in the morning. I tell myself I will take a shower in the morning instead, early, when the pipes are rested, when the floors are dry.

In the dorm, I climb into bed. The fan whirs. The air is thick. I can hear the shower down the hall run, the water hitting tile. It sounds like applause, like rain. Someone coughs. A phone buzzes. The building creaks, its old bones settling. I close my eyes and see the crack in the tile, the way the hook bent in my hand. I can still feel the slip, a small betrayal.

Sleep comes in pieces. I dream of a long corridor with doors that open into bathrooms with no floors. I wake once to the sound of a groan, the pipes singing to themselves. I tell myself it is nothing. I tell myself, again, that I am not afraid.

Morning arrives as a damp gray. Light seeps into the room in thin strips. I check my phone. No messages, no updates. My knee is stiff. I rub it and feel the bruise beneath the skin. A small souvenir. I consider skipping the shower. I consider the day ahead, the meetings, the camera, the version of myself that looks polished on screen. I consider how water makes me feel clean in a way that no amount of deodorant can.

I take my towel. The hall is empty. The tile under my feet is cold. I tell myself I will be careful. I tell myself I will use the mats. I tell myself not to let a building make me change my routine. That is what it is, the routine. It is what keeps me from falling apart in strange cities. It is what turns fear into a checklist.

The bathroom door is closed. There is a new sign taped to it, one I did not see last night: SHOWERS OUT OF ORDER. USE SINKS FOR WASHING. Next to it, in the same pen as before, someone has written: YOU CAN'T STOP WATER.

I stand there with my hand on the knob. I hear a distant drip. The pipes are quiet. The building is breathing. I look at the sign, then at my reflection in the scratched metal of the door plate. My hair is sticking up. My eyes are bloodshot. I smell like sleep and the bus.

I turn the knob anyway.
