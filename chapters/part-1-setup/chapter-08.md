# Chapter 08: The Quiet Hour

The worst sound in a hostel is not the shouting or the music or the occasional crash of a plate dying on tile. It is the quiet when your own heart is too loud.

I wake to that quiet, the thin slice of morning that slips between the night's chaos and the bar's first cough. My tongue is a dry sponge. My head is a dark room with a strobe light left on. The air in the dorm is thick and damp, a stew of sweat, stale beer, and the citrus cleaner they use like a prayer. Someone has left the window open a crack, and the cold from outside crawls along the floor, licking my ankles.

My phone is under my pillow. I find it by feel, the screen lighting up my face with a blue accusation. Two messages from Mum. Three from my sister. The last one is a voice note. I don't listen. I can imagine her voice, the tight edge of it, the way she says my name like it's a rope she is trying to throw across an ocean. I lock the screen. I tell myself I'll listen later, in a better mood, when I can be the version of me she wants to hear.

The guy on the top bunk shifts and a sock drops onto my face. I peel it off and throw it onto the floor without looking. It lands near the bucket by the door, the one that has caught a hundred misses and smells like ammonia and grief. There is writing on the wall above it: AIM FOR THE BUCKET. The handwriting is neat and a little too optimistic. The bucket is empty this morning, which feels like a miracle. Miracles are always temporary.

I sit up slowly. The room tilts, then settles. That is my first test. Passed. My second test is standing. I swing my legs down. The floor is sticky. The suction sound of my flip-flops peeling up is the closest thing to applause this room gets. I find my towel, still damp, and drape it around my neck. It smells like mildew and a day I can't remember.

Outside, the hallway is a tunnel of graffiti and low light. The fluorescent bulb buzzes like an insect. The wet floor sign leans against the wall, forever on its side, a warning turned into decoration. The mop bucket under the stairs is still there, catching the drip from the ceiling. Plink. Plink. Plink. The drip is patient and steady, an unofficial metronome for this building.

Marta is on her knees by the bathroom, pushing a rag around the puddle like she is trying to erase time. She is muttering in Czech. I don't know the words, but I know the tone. It is the sound of someone who has asked for help too many times.

"You alive," she says without looking up.

"Always," I say. It is a lie, but it is easy.

She glances toward the shower stalls, then back at me. "Not shower now. Floor full. Drain angry." She points with her chin at a pool of water that has no intention of leaving.

I look into the bathroom. The light flickers once, then steadies. The mirrors are fogged. A thin mist hangs in the air. The second stall from the left is open, the curtain caught on itself. The concrete floor in there is darker than the rest, slick and shining, a lake you could drown in with no one noticing. The pipe is there, always there, a blunt copper finger pointing at head height, a signature of neglect.

"Someone left the water on?" I ask.

Marta snorts. "Someone always leaves water on. You all think water is infinite." She wrings the rag. The water drips into the same puddle she is trying to clear. "Maybe later. When drain less stupid." She looks at me then, and her eyes are tired but not unkind. "You need sleep, not shower."

Sleep. That is the word she chooses, like she knows the thing I keep trying to drown with beer. I laugh it off because that is what I do. "Sleep is for when I'm dead," I say, because the wall says it and the crowd likes it and it keeps me safe from my own voice.

She doesn't laugh. "Floor don't care about slogans," she says, and goes back to mopping.

I step back from the bathroom and tell myself I'll shower later, after the puddle dries, after the drain decides to do its job, after the world stops wobbling. I have said this before. It is a script.

Downstairs, the bar is in its quiet hour. Kuba is behind the counter, wiping the same spot with a rag that has seen too much. The neon sign hums, a soft electric pulse. The bar smells like stale beer and toast, like a regret that has been reheated.

"You look like you lost a fight with a tram," Kuba says, sliding a glass of water toward me.

"The tram won," I say. I drink the water in three gulps. It tastes like pipes and cold metal. It makes my stomach turn, then settle.

A couple of new arrivals are hovering by the Polaroid wall, their bags still on their backs, their faces clean with the kind of optimism you can smell. One of them points at a photo of a guy passed out in the sink. The caption says WELCOME HOME. They laugh.

"You doing tour today?" Kuba asks.

"Maybe," I say. "Depends if my head stops being a disco."

He pours himself a coffee. The smell is burnt and honest. "You should eat," he says. "You are thin like a Czech ghost."

"I am a ghost," I say. "I died in the shower."

"Not yet," he says, and his smile is the same one he uses when he is half joking and half not.

I make a piece of toast in the kitchen. It comes out half-charred, half-raw. I eat it anyway. The kitchen whiteboard still says DRINK WATER OR DIE. Someone has added a smiley face with Xs for eyes. I take a photo of it. I don't post it.

The quiet hour ends when the first laugh turns the volume up. A group of Brits come in, hair wet, towels around their shoulders, grinning like survivors. One of them is barefoot, his toes gray from the hallway. I want to tell him to put on flip-flops. I don't. I am not his dad. I am the guy who tells people this place is legendary.

"Brad," Kuba says, nodding toward the newcomers. "Tour."

I could say no. I could say I'm done, I'm tired, I'm going to take a nap and call my mum. Instead I stand up. The habit is automatic. The role fits like a glove I never asked for.

"Alright, legends," I say, loud enough for the bar to hear. "Welcome to Mad House Prague, home of bad decisions and good stories."

They laugh. They are here for exactly that. I show them the bar, the wall of Polaroids, the shame board of morning-after photos. I point out the rage cage, which is a storage room with a couch but sounds like a myth. I warn them about the showers in the tone I always use, half joke, half shrug. "Wear thongs, don't run, and watch out for the pipe in the second stall. It's a bit bitey." They laugh. They will remember the joke, not the pipe.

One of them, a girl with a purple streak in her hair, asks me how long I've been here. "Two weeks," I say, and it sounds longer than it is. She whistles. "Legend," she says. The word lands on me like a compliment and a warning.

When the tour is over, I go back to the bar and sit. The room has filled. The quiet hour is gone. The lights are brighter. The music is low but present, a thump under the surface. The dog from the courtyard wanders in and rests its head on my knee. I scratch behind its ear. It sighs like an old man.

My phone buzzes again. Another message from my sister. I don't open it. Instead I open my Instagram and watch my own story from last night. I look like a man having the time of his life. I look like a man who could keep going forever. I scroll through the comments. Fire emojis. "Legend." "Lad." "Goalz." It is the kind of attention that feeds you without ever making you full.

I tell myself I'll call her later. I tell myself I'm too hungover to talk. I tell myself I don't want her to hear the slur in my voice. The truth is I don't want to hear the worry in hers.

By afternoon, the city is doing its thing outside, trams squealing and tourists shuffling, the air tasting like wet stone and cigarette smoke. Inside, the hostel hums. People are playing cards at the long table. Someone is cooking goulash in the kitchen, the smell of paprika and meat thick in the air. The courtyard fountain is burbling, coughing water into a basin full of coins and cigarette butts. The weather is cold and damp, the kind that gets into your bones even when you are inside.

Liv finds me by the bar, a cider in her hand, her hair tied up like she couldn't be bothered. She drops into the seat next to me with a sigh.

"You look like a before photo," she says.

"You look like an after photo," I say.

She laughs and clinks her glass against mine. "You doing the crawl tonight?"

"Maybe," I say, which is my answer to everything that should be no.

We sit there for a while, talking about nothing. She tells me about Leeds, about the rain there being different, more constant, like it never leaves. I tell her about the Gold Coast, about the sun that feels like it wants you dead if you stay out too long. We compare hangover cures. She swears by a full English breakfast. I swear by beer. We both laugh like we believe ourselves.

She looks at me over the rim of her glass. "You ever think about going home?"

The question is casual, tossed like a piece of ice into a drink. It lands cold in my chest.

"Home is boring," I say. It is the line that has saved me for years. It sounds like confidence. It sounds like freedom. It is a lie, and I know it.

"Maybe boring isn't bad," she says, and I feel the urge to argue, but I don't. I stare at the wet bar top instead. It is sticky. It holds the ring of my glass like a bruise.

There is a lull in the noise, just for a second, and in it I hear my own stomach growl. I realize I haven't eaten since the toast. I make a sandwich in the kitchen, two slices of bread and whatever looks least likely to poison me. The goulash is still bubbling on the stove, stirring itself in slow circles. I take a bowl. It is thick and hot and tastes like someone tried. It sits in my stomach like a warm stone. It helps.

I check my phone in the corner of the kitchen, away from the bar noise. I open my sister's last message. It is a photo of our mum at the kitchen table, mug in her hands, eyes tired. The caption says: She worries. Just call.

My throat tightens. The kitchen suddenly feels too small. I step outside into the courtyard, my bowl of goulash abandoned on the counter. The air is cold. The courtyard stones are wet and reflective. The fairy lights are still up from last night, off in the daylight, little glass bulbs like eyes that have closed.

I call my sister. It rings once, twice, and then she answers in a rush, like she has been holding her breath. "Brad?"

"Yeah," I say. My voice sounds like sand.

"Jesus, it's about time. Are you okay?"

The question is a trap. I can answer it honestly and turn this call into a confession, or I can answer it like a joke and keep my armor on. I choose the armor.

"I'm sweet," I say. "Living the dream."

She exhales, not a laugh. "Mum's losing it, you know. She thinks you're dead in a ditch somewhere."

"I'm not in a ditch," I say. "I'm in a hostel. There's a difference." I make it a joke. It sounds like a joke.

There is a pause. In the quiet, I hear the fountain cough. I hear someone laugh inside. I hear the drip from the eaves.

"Brad," she says, softer. "You don't have to do this."

"Do what?"

"Whatever this is." She is trying not to sound angry. It makes it worse. "You're not you on the phone. You're always..." She trails off, searching for a word that won't cut. "You're always on." She says it like she is tired of the performance.

My chest tightens. I lean my head back against the cold stone wall. The dampness seeps through my shirt. "I'm just traveling," I say. "It's fine. It's fun."

"You said you'd call every week," she says. "You said you'd slow down."

"I will," I say. I have said that a hundred times. It has never been true.

The courtyard is empty except for the dog sleeping under a bench. I watch its chest rise and fall. The quiet is too big. I can feel the edges of my own anxiety like a fever.

"Mum's birthday is next week," she says. "You going to call her?"

"Yeah," I say too fast. "Of course."

There is another pause. I can hear her breathing. I can hear my own, too, the way it catches a little. For a second, I want to tell her everything. That I'm tired. That I don't know how to stop. That I wake up and I am scared and I drink because it makes the fear a little quieter. But the words are stuck, and the bar noise inside is getting louder, calling me back to the noise where I don't have to say any of this.

"Alright," she says. "Just... call her. And please, be careful."

"Always," I say, and hate myself a little.

She starts to say something else, then stops. I can hear the bar inside, the way the music leaks into the courtyard like a spill. I can hear my own breathing, shallow and quick. My skin feels too tight, like it has shrunk around me. There is a faint tremor in my hands, the kind I pretend is from caffeine or cold. My heart thuds too hard for the amount of effort I'm making. I think about telling her that the showers here are dangerous, that the floor is slick and the pipe looks like a tooth, that the building groans and the water comes out brown sometimes. I think about telling her I nearly fell yesterday and laughed like it was a joke. I don't tell her any of it. I just stand there, phone against my ear, letting the silence do the work.

We hang up. I stand there in the courtyard, phone in my hand, the screen dark. The cold has moved into my bones. I take a breath. It doesn't help. I go back inside because that is the only direction my feet know.

Inside, the bar is louder. Someone has put on a playlist that sounds like every club I've ever been to. Kuba is pouring beers. Marta is mopping again, her mop a slow, tired pendulum. The floor is wet. The warning sign is leaning. The drip still counts time.

I take a beer from the bar without asking. The first sip is the usual magic trick. It smooths the tightness in my chest, blurs the edges of my thoughts. It makes the call with my sister feel like something that happened to someone else.

Liv raises an eyebrow. "That was quick."

"Family stuff," I say, and she nods, which is the kindest thing she could do.

We play a few rounds of cards. I lose on purpose and then win without trying. The room spins gently, the way a boat does when the water is calm. The beer keeps coming. The afternoon slants toward evening. The hostel shifts into its night skin, the one where everything is dimmer and louder and the air is thick with anticipation.

---

Night in Mad House is a script with no intermission. The bar fills. The music turns up. People put on their best shirts and their worst decisions. The neon signs glow like promises. The air is hot with bodies and beer and cheap perfume. The courtyard is a cigarette haze under fairy lights. The rage cage opens in the basement, a low room with a couch and a speaker and the kind of energy that feels like a dare.

I go down there with a group because it's where the noise is. The basement smells like damp concrete and spilled vodka. The walls are covered in graffiti, layered names and dates, declarations of love and drunk philosophy. Someone has written STAY DEAD in big letters. Someone else has crossed out DEAD and written WILD. The correction is uneven and petty. It feels right.

Shots appear in my hand like magic. Someone pours absinthe, the green kind that burns on the way down and makes the room look softer. I take it because it is offered and because saying no is a muscle I never trained. The burn is familiar. The warmth spreads. The tightness in my chest loosens. The room gets blurry around the edges.

At one point, I lean against the wall and look at my hands. They are steady. They shouldn't be. I wiggle my fingers and watch them move like they belong to someone else. I laugh out loud. It startles the girl next to me. She laughs too.

We dance. We shout. We chant each other's names because it feels like power to be called out in a crowd. Someone puts on a song I love and I scream the words, even though I don't know all of them. I lift my cup and spill half of it on my shorts. It doesn't matter. Nothing matters in a room where the bass is louder than your thoughts.

Then, in the middle of a song, the power flickers. The lights stutter. The music cuts out for a half second, then slams back in. The room cheers like it was a trick. I feel my stomach drop. The flicker makes me think of the bathroom light, the way it hesitates before it commits to shining. I think of the pipe. I think of Marta's face when she said the floor is hungry. I take another shot to shut that thought up.

At some point, I go upstairs for air. The hallway is quiet compared to the basement. The fluorescent light hums. The wet floor sign is still there. The drip from the ceiling is still counting. Plink. Plink. Plink. I breathe in the cooler air and it feels like I am surfacing from underwater.

The bathroom door is ajar. The light inside flickers. I walk past, then stop. The door is open just enough that I can see the second stall. The concrete floor gleams with water. The drain looks like a dark eye. The pipe sits at head height, catching the light. For a second, I imagine my head hitting it. The image is so sharp it makes my stomach flip.

"Don't be weird," I whisper to myself. The words sound small in the hallway.

I use the toilet, wash my hands, and avoid looking too long at anything. The water is cold and metallic. It makes my fingers ache. I dry them on my shorts. The mirror is smeared. My face looks pale under the flickering light, eyes too bright. I look like someone else. I look like a ghost in a hostel bathroom, which is a joke I would make if I felt like laughing.

Back in the bar, the noise swallows me. I find Liv on the edge of the crowd, her face flushed, her eyes bright. We dance for a while. She laughs and spins and I catch her. The room is a blur of bodies and light. I feel almost happy. I feel almost safe. The beer keeps coming. The hours evaporate.

By three, the bar has thinned, the survivors and the staff left, the rest passed out in corners or gone to bed. Kuba is still pouring drinks like it is noon. His eyes are red. His grin is unchanged. He pours me one more and says, "Last one."

"You said that two hours ago," I say.

"I lie to myself too," he says, and we both laugh like it is fine.

I climb the stairs, my legs heavy, the hallway tilting slightly. The light flickers like a heartbeat. The drip keeps time. The mop bucket under the stairs is full, the water inside reflecting the ceiling light in a shaky mirror. I catch my reflection in it for a second. It looks like a face in a puddle, distorted and tired. I look away.

In the dorm, the air is thick. The fan is on but it only pushes the smells around. I strip down and collapse on the bunk. The mattress is damp. The pillow smells like someone else's hair. I pull the thin blanket up and stare at the slats above me.

The room is quiet now, just the hum of the fan and the occasional snore. This is the quiet hour again, but darker, heavier. The noise is gone and my own thoughts come rushing in like a tide.

I take my phone out. My sister's messages sit there. Mum's too. I scroll back to an old photo of us at the beach, my sister making a face, me holding a surfboard I could barely stand on. Mum is in the background, sunburned and laughing, her mouth wide with it. We look like people who belong together. The photo makes my throat hurt.

I don't know why I do this. I don't know when it stopped being fun and started being a habit and then became the only thing I'm good at. I don't know how to be Brad without the Lad. I don't know how to wake up and not reach for a beer like it's a life jacket.

My chest tightens. My eyes sting. I turn my face into the pillow so no one can hear. The sob that comes out is small and quiet, just a leak, just a drip. I bite my lip to keep it from getting louder. The tears make the pillow damp. The damp makes it smell like mildew and home.

I cry for a minute. Maybe two. Then I wipe my face on the sheet and tell myself to stop. I am not that guy. I am the guy who is fine. I am the guy who makes people laugh. I am the guy who says sleep when I'm dead. I am not the guy who cries in a hostel bunk at four in the morning.

But I did. So maybe I am.

The quiet makes every sound bigger. The drip in the hallway sounds like a clock. The pipes in the walls tick as they cool. Somewhere, a toilet flushes. I listen to all of it because it keeps me from listening to myself.

I turn on my side and close my eyes. The room sways. The night moves. I tell myself tomorrow I will be better. I will drink less. I will eat more. I will call Mum. I will take a proper shower and wash this off. I promise it to myself the way I always do, because promises are easy at four in the morning when no one is listening.

The last thing I hear before sleep takes me is the shower turning on somewhere down the hall. The water rushes, then roars. The sound is a long, steady hiss, like a snake in the walls. It is the sound I associate with clean. It is also the sound of the place that keeps swallowing my promises.

I let it lull me. I let it lie to me. I let it say, for now, that tomorrow will be different.
