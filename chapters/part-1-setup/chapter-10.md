# Chapter 10: The Last Easy Morning

The worst part of waking up in Mad House is the way the building itself seems hungover.

It groans when I move. Pipes tick as if they are counting down to something. The hallway fan makes the same tired whir every morning, like a smoker's laugh. Even the light outside the dorm is dimmer than it should be, flickering in a slow rhythm that matches the pulsing behind my eyes.

My mouth tastes like pennies and the cheap lime of last night's shots. The mattress sticks to the small of my back when I sit up. The air is stale and humid, a soup of sweat and detergent and the ghost of vomit that never leaves no matter how many times Marta scrubs. Somewhere in the room, someone is snoring like a chainsaw. Someone else mumbles in their sleep, words spilling like beer over a table.

I swing my legs off the bunk and my ankles wobble. The floor is cold against the soft underside of my feet. I find my thongs by feel, the rubber strap hooking between my toes like a little promise. I stand, sway, catch myself on the metal ladder. The metal is cold, slick with other people's sweat. It grounds me.

My phone is under my pillow, warm and damp. It buzzes when I touch it, like it is annoyed to be woken. Two missed messages. One from Mum: You up? Another from my sister: Are you okay? I stare at the screen as if it is a trap. I tell myself I'll reply after I drink water. I tell myself a lot of things.

The dorm is a landscape of bodies, a battlefield after the party. There are legs hanging off bunks, a pile of clothes that smells like old beer, a plastic cup turned sideways on the floor with a little puddle under it like a tear. The bucket in the corner is empty, the only victory of the night. I step over a tangle of flip-flops and make it to the door.

The hallway is colder, a draft along my skin. The thin line of water is back, glinting in the emergency light like a warning stripe. It starts at the bathroom door and snakes past the stairs. I step over it, then step back and around it because my head is heavy and I'm not sure I trust my own feet.

Marta is at the far end, mop in hand, doing the same slow arc she always does. Her hair is tied up in a knot and her face is a blank page. She looks at me the way you look at a broken cupboard that keeps refusing to close.

"Morning," I say. My voice is too loud in the quiet.

She makes a sound that might be a greeting or a sigh. "Floor not dry," she says.

"It never is," I say.

She angles the mop. "Then don't fall." It sounds like a joke in her mouth and a fact in mine.

I should go back to bed. I should drink water and take a nap and pretend I'm a responsible adult. Instead I push the bathroom door open and let the warm, wet air hit me in the face. It smells like mildew and cheap soap and the metallic tang of pipes that haven't been replaced in years.

The light flickers, then steadies as if deciding I'm worth the effort. The mirror above the sinks is fogged, every reflection a ghost. A toothbrush sits in a cracked glass like a lonely flower. The sinks are ringed with toothpaste and hair. The floor is slick. There is a soft puddle around the drain in the shower area, the water the color of weak tea.

Someone is in a stall, the curtain pulled. I hear a cough, then a wet retch. The sound makes my stomach kick. I shuffle to the sink and turn on the tap. The water comes out brown for a second, then clear. It is cold enough to make me gasp. I cup it and drink like a dog. It tastes like rust and a little bleach. It sits in my stomach like a rock, which is better than the emptiness.

I splash my face. The cold stings. I look up and see my own eyes, red and swollen, doubled in the fog. The bleached tips of my hair are grown out, the blond now the color of old straw. There is a bruise on my collarbone that I don't remember earning. I touch it and it aches. A mystery souvenir.

In the corner of the mirror, someone has drawn a smiley face in the fog with a wet finger. The eyes are Xs. It fades as I watch. Everything fades in this place, even jokes.

The second stall is open, its curtain half-hooked like a mouth left ajar. The concrete floor inside is dark with water. The pipe is there, copper and capped, a knuckle in the wall. It catches the light when it flickers, a tiny glint that makes my eyes go to it even when I don't want them to. I stare for a second longer than I should, then look away.

A guy in the sink beside me is brushing his teeth with the focus of someone defusing a bomb. He is wearing shower flip-flops, thick rubber, the kind you can buy downstairs for five euros. The soles are ribbed, like treads on a tire. He sees me looking and shrugs.

"Didn't fancy dying in there," he says through foam.

I laugh because it's funny and not funny at the same time. "Fair," I say.

He spits and leaves, his flip-flops squeaking on the wet tile. The sound follows me as I dry my face with my shirt and step back into the hallway. Marta is still mopping. The line of water is thinner now but still there, stubborn as a hangover.

Back in the dorm, I sit on my bunk and stare at my phone. The messages glow in the dim room. I type, Up now, all good, and send it to Mum. I type, Yeah, just tired, and send it to my sister. The words feel like paper masks. The blue ticks appear. The masks stick.

I lie back for a minute and let the mattress take my weight. My head pulses in time with the drip in the hallway. I close my eyes and see the pipe in the shower, the flicker of light, the way the wet floor shines like ice. I open my eyes and sit up again. Staying still is when the bad thoughts get louder.

I pull on my shorts, my singlet, the uniform. I check my pockets: lighter, coins, a crumpled receipt, the laminated wristband that says MAD HOUSE like a brand. I slip my thongs on and head downstairs toward the bar, toward noise, toward anything that isn't me thinking about myself.

---

By noon the hostel has warmed into its daily haze. The bar is open but sleepy, the music a low thump that feels like a heartbeat under a blanket. The smell of goulash drifts from the kitchen, heavy and comforting and wrong this early. A couple of Germans are arguing over the coffee machine, a French girl is cutting toast with the back of a spoon, and someone is already pouring beer into a plastic cup with the solemnity of a priest.

Kuba is behind the bar with a rag and a tired smile. He nods at me like we are old friends in a war.

"Alive," he says.

"Barely," I say.

"You said that yesterday." He slides a glass of water toward me, then a coffee that smells like burnt dirt. "Hydrate. Then you can ruin yourself." He says it like a blessing.

I drink the water, then the coffee, then a beer because I am not here to be healthy. The beer is cold, the taste sharp and bitter, a line drawn in my head between feeling like death and feeling like life. It works the way it always does. It smooths the edges.

Liv drops onto the stool next to me with a groan. Her hair is a tangled halo. There is a bruise on her knee, fresh and purple.

"How'd you get that?" I ask.

She looks down and shrugs. "Dance floor, chair, gravity. The usual." She lifts her cup in a tiny toast. "To gravity." We clink. The plastic makes a cheap sound.

We sit in the early quiet. Outside, the street is damp and gray. Tourists with umbrellas move like a slow river. Inside, the air is warm, almost sticky. The bar top is tacky under my palm. There is a ring of dried beer where someone's cup used to be. It looks like a halo, too.

A couple of new arrivals come down the stairs, backpacks still on, eyes bright. They hover at the bottom like deer on a road. I see myself in them, three weeks ago, fresh and hungry for a good story. I wave them over.

"Welcome to Mad House," I say. "I'm Brad. You here to ruin your life?" It gets a laugh. It always gets a laugh.

They ask about the showers, because everyone does, and I give the speech I have given a hundred times. "They're dodgy as," I say. "Wear thongs, mind the pipe in the middle stall, don't shower pissed. You'll be right." I hear myself as if I'm someone else, a tour guide in a museum of hazards. The new guy with a baseball cap nods like he will listen. The girl with a nose ring laughs like she won't. I should feel guilty for turning danger into a punchline. I feel something like it, a small itch under my skin.

Kuba leans over and says, "You're good at that." I take it as a compliment and a warning and ignore the warning part.

After the tour, I post a story. It's a shaky shot of the bar, the wall of Polaroids, the shame board with last night's faces clipped to it like trophies. I add the red-eye filter because my own eyes are too red to show the world. I caption it DAY 15 IN PRAGUE STILL GOING STRONG with a beer emoji. The lie is bright and tidy. The phone buzzes as a few people react. It feels like applause.

Liv asks if I'm going on the pub crawl again tonight. I tell her maybe. We both know what maybe means. It means yes. It means I will tell myself no in the afternoon and say yes by six.

We eat the goulash when it comes out, thick and salty, served in chipped bowls. It warms my stomach. It makes me think of home, of Mum's cooking, of the way she used to put an extra potato on my plate because she said I was growing. I'm not growing anymore. I'm just filling space.

A guy at the next table is telling a story about a rooftop party in Budapest that ended with a police chase. Everyone laughs at the right parts. I laugh too, even though my head throbs with the effort. The room is full of laughter and the clink of cups. The hostel is alive in its daily cycle, a machine that runs on hangovers and alcohol and the soft denial that we are all here for the same reason.

After lunch, Liv dares me to step outside. "We should see the city," she says, like it's a radical idea. We pull on jackets and head out into the cold, the hostel door slamming behind us with a metallic thunk that feels like a heartbeat resetting.

Prague in the daylight is a different creature. The street is wet from an earlier rain, the cobblestones slick and uneven. Old buildings lean over us in pastel colors, their facades decorated with statues and scrollwork and black iron balconies that look like they have seen too much. A tram rattles past, its bell a cheerful clank. People walk with purpose, carrying groceries, dogs, schoolbags. They are not hungover, or if they are they don't wear it like we do.

We drift toward the river without a map. The air smells like cigarette smoke and coffee and the sweet cinnamon of trdelnik stands. A vendor waves a chimney cake at us, sugar glittering on the spiral pastry. We buy one and it burns our fingers. We tear off chunks and eat them too fast, the sugar sticking to our lips. It tastes like childhood and like a tourist trap and like a small, warm lie.

On Charles Bridge, the crowd is thick with cameras and umbrellas. A busker plays violin, the notes thin in the cold. The Vltava moves beneath us, a slow, dark ribbon with little boats sliding over it. I lean on the stone and look down. The water is black and the idea of falling into it makes my stomach flip. I step back and laugh it off, and Liv raises an eyebrow like she felt that too.

"You're pale," she says.

"I'm Australian," I say. "We don't do winter."

"You don't do water either," she says, nodding at the river. "Except beer." She grins, but there's a softness behind it.

I want to tell her about the messages from my sister, about the way the phone feels heavier in my pocket these days. Instead I tell her about the time I nearly got swept out at Currumbin Creek when I was ten. She laughs. I laugh. We both pretend we are just two travelers having a nice day.

My head swims when we climb the steps up from the river. I grab the railing, cold iron biting my palm. A gust of wind catches me and for a second the city tilts. I blink hard and focus on the wet cobblestones in front of me. My ankle slips a fraction on the slick stone. I catch myself and look up at Liv like it was a joke. She doesn't laugh.

"Maybe you should slow down tonight," she says.

"I'll go easy," I say, because that is the answer I always give. It sounds good. It feels like a compromise. It is a lie with good intentions.

We stop at a convenience shop on the way back. Liv buys gum. I buy a pack of instant noodles and a cheap bottle of sports drink that promises electrolytes in neon letters. It sits cold in my hand like a talisman. The cashier doesn't look at us. He has seen a thousand of us.

Back at the hostel, the warmth hits me like a wet towel. The air is thick with beer and bodies again. The line of water in the hallway is still there, a glistening reminder that the outside world doesn't come inside unless you bring it in.

In the afternoon, I nap in the chill room with a pillow that smells like someone else's shampoo. The couch is lumpy and damp. My sleep is shallow, a series of quick dives into black water. I wake with a start when someone shouts in the bar, the sound slicing through the air. My heart is too fast. I lie there and stare at the ceiling, at the peeling paint and the water stain shaped like a map. The stain looks like Australia. I laugh, because of course it does. I think about the ocean. I think about my sister's last call, her voice small and tight. I think about how I promised her I'd slow down. I think about the beer in my hand later and the way I will forget I promised anything at all.

The afternoon blurs into late day. The light outside goes from gray to gold and then to blue. The hostel shifts into its night skin. The music gets louder. The air gets thicker. The bar fills with bodies and stories. I am in my element, a fish in dirty water.

I tell myself tonight will be easy. Just a few beers. A simple crawl. No absinthe, no mystery shots. I say this to Liv and to myself as I pour the first drink. The words land on the surface and float away.

---

Night in Mad House is a beast with a friendly face. It smiles at you and hands you a cup.

We start with pre-drinks in the bar, the ritual that makes everyone feel like family before they spill into the city. The music is loud enough to make the walls hum. The lights are low and warm. The air smells like body spray and sweat and the lemon cleaner Marta used this morning, all mixed into something that feels like a party in a bottle.

I drink my beer and feel it dissolve the last of the day from my muscles. My shoulders loosen. My head goes fuzzy around the edges. Someone starts a chant, my name in it, and I lift my cup like I'm on a stage. It is stupid and perfect. I love it and I hate it for the same reason.

The crawl is the usual blur: sticky floors, cheap shots, a club with lasers that make everyone's eyes look demonic, a pub that smells like wet coats and old smoke. We walk the cobblestones in a herd, laughing too loud. The cold air sobers me for a second at a time, then the next drink drowns it again.

On the walk between bars, we cut through a narrow street where the noise drops off. The buildings lean in, old stone shoulders. Somewhere a church bell strikes an hour I don't believe. A couple sits on a bench eating fries from a paper cone, their heads touching. They glance at us like we're a weather pattern. For a moment I want to peel away from the group, to stand in the quiet and listen to the city breathe. It smells like wet stone and fried meat and the faint sweetness of a bakery closing up for the night. It smells like a place people live, not just a stage for us to stumble through.

We pass the Astronomical Clock, its face glowing gold and blue. Tourists still gather even at this hour, cameras up, waiting for a show that isn't scheduled. A local walks past without looking up. I look up anyway. The clock has been telling time for centuries. It doesn't care about my hangover or my plans. The thought makes me laugh, which makes my head hurt, which makes me take another sip of my drink like it's medicine.

At the next bar, a guy from Canada tells me about his job back home and how he took a year to travel before life swallowed him. He asks what I'm doing after Prague. I say, "Depends how long the party lasts." It gets a laugh. The truth is I don't know. The truth is I have stopped looking past tomorrow because tomorrow already feels like a stretch.

Outside the bar, the sidewalk is slick with a thin sheen of melting snow. I step off the curb and my foot slides half an inch. I catch myself on the shoulder of a passing Dutch guy who doesn't notice. The jolt of almost-falling shoots through me and then is gone. I shake it off like a dog shakes off water. The herd moves on. I move with it.

At some point, outside a bar with a neon sign that flickers like a dying star, I check my phone. There is another message from Mum. There is another from my sister. The words are small on the screen. I could call. I could step out of the herd and lean against a wall and listen to their voices. I could say I'm okay. I could say I'm not. The thought makes my throat tight. I shove the phone back in my pocket and follow the others inside.

We end up back at the hostel after midnight, the courtyard filled with smoke and laughter. The fountain coughs. The fairy lights tremble in the wind. Someone is making grilled cheese in the kitchen because hunger is a loop as strong as thirst. The shame board is already filling with tonight's new disasters. I see a photo of myself from last night and laugh so I don't have to think about how I look, how I am starting to look.

The party spills into the basement, into the rage cage. The air down there is warm and damp and tastes like old beer. Someone has set up a speaker on the laundry machine. The bass makes the pipes vibrate. The pipe above the couch drips onto the floor in a steady rhythm. Drip. Drip. Drip. We dance around it without noticing.

I lose track of time. I lose track of the number of beers. I am on the edge of numb, the place where everything feels possible because nothing feels real. In the bathroom at some point, I splash water on my face and it slides off like it can't stick to me. I grin at myself in the mirror, at the tired eyes and the wild hair. I look like someone having the time of his life. I am someone having the time of his life. Both can be true and untrue at the same time.

At three, the party starts to sag. People peel away to their dorms in small groups. Liv kisses my cheek and says, "Don't die," and laughs like it's a joke. I laugh too. We both know it's a joke. We both know jokes are how we say things we are afraid to say plainly.

I climb the stairs slowly, one hand on the rail. The air in the stairwell is cooler, the smell of beer fading to the smell of damp concrete. The rail is slick under my palm. The light above the third floor flickers, then steadies, then flickers again. It makes the hallway strobe in a slow, tired rhythm.

The wet floor sign is on its side again, like it gave up. The line of water is there, shining in the emergency light. I step over it and almost miss, my foot sliding a half inch. The jolt runs up my leg and into my stomach. My heart kicks. I laugh, loud and too sharp, the sound echoing down the hall. No one hears me. The hallway is empty. The joke lands nowhere.

The bathroom door is ajar. Warm, damp air spills out, carrying the smell of mildew and soap. The light inside flickers like a bad memory. The second stall is visible from here, the curtain pulled back, the pipe glinting in the dim. The floor around the drain is dark and glossy with water that refuses to go away.

I stand in the doorway for a second. My skin itches with sweat and smoke. My head is full of noise. The idea of a shower is a bright, clean thing. The idea of stepping on that slick floor with my head swimming is a darker thing. I stare at the pipe and the wet concrete and the thin line of water in the hallway. I could do it now, I tell myself. I could be careful. I could be fine.

My stomach rolls. I think of Marta's face, of her saying don't fall. I think of the guy in flip-flops who didn't fancy dying in there. I think of Liv's joke. I think of the bruise I don't remember. I think of my sister's last message, the way it sat on my screen like a hand on my shoulder.

"Tomorrow," I say to the doorframe. My voice is a slur in the quiet. "Morning shower. Easy." It sounds like a plan. It sounds like a promise.

I turn away and head to the dorm, the floor swaying beneath me. The mattress takes me like a wave. I close my eyes and the light behind my eyelids flickers in the same rhythm as the hallway bulb. The sound of a shower turns on somewhere down the hall, the water rushing, then roaring. It sounds like a warning. It sounds like sleep.

I let it carry me under.
