# Chapter 06: The Half-Closed Door

The first thing I hear is water, and for a second I think I am back on the Gold Coast, under a wave that won't let me up.

Then the wave turns into pipes, the pipes turn into the hostel, and the hostel turns into morning, which is always louder than it should be. A shower runs somewhere down the hall, the roar steady, indifferent, and the bass from the bar below is still thudding even though it is not even ten. The bunk above me creaks as someone rolls over. The smell in the room is a damp towel and old beer and the faint, sweet promise of whatever chemical they mop with when they remember to.

I open my eyes to the underside of the top bunk, the same zebra slats I have been staring at for two weeks. There is a sock stuck between them like a flag. The air is cold at my feet, hot at my face. My mouth tastes like a pub floor. My tongue is sandpaper. My head is a drum kit and someone is doing soundcheck.

My phone buzzes. A notification from Mum sits there like a guilt trip in pocket form. I don't open it. If I open it, I have to answer. If I answer, I have to admit I am not okay. If I don't open it, I get to pretend I am still a person who just sleeps in.

I swing my legs down. The floor grabs at my feet with that sticky hostel tile suction, a sound like tape peeling. My thighs ache from dancing and something else I can't name. There is a bruise on my shin shaped like a thumb. I poke it and wince. Another mystery solved. Another story I can invent if anyone asks.

A guy on the other side of the room lifts his head and asks if I want a cigarette in a language that doesn't sound like English. I say no and thank you anyway. He shrugs and disappears into his blanket.

I sit for a moment, breathing through my mouth so I don't have to smell the bucket by the door. The bucket is full, the plastic rim stained brown from last night's miss. Someone has written KEEP IT IN THE BUCKET on the wall above it. The handwriting is neat, like a teacher's. The message feels like it should be about more than puke.

I stand. The room tilts and comes back. That is my morning test. Passed, just.

My towel is damp from last night's tears and last night's shower. It smells like mildew and cheap soap. I drape it over my shoulder anyway. I find my flip-flops under my bed, one right side up, one on its face like it passed out. I slide my feet into them. Rubber saints, a thin salvation.

In the hallway, the light flickers, then steadies. A yellow CAUTION WET FLOOR sign leans against the wall like it's tired of trying. The mop bucket is still by the stairs, catching a drip from the ceiling that has been dripping since I got here. It is patient. The drip makes a soft sound, like a clock.

A girl in a hostel robe rushes past me toward the bathroom, hair in a wet bun, mascara on her cheek. She doesn't have flip-flops on. Her bare feet slap the tile. I watch her go, a tiny part of me wanting to call out. I don't. I am not her dad. I am not anyone's dad. I am the guy who doesn't say no.

Marta is in the hallway, pushing her mop in circles that never seem to get the floor any drier. She is muttering in Czech, a low, angry prayer. When she sees me, she lifts her chin.

"You alive," she says.

"Barely," I say, because that has become my entire vocabulary.

She nods toward the bathroom. "Shower left one running. Again. Someone forget. Flood again. You all same." She says it like a curse.

"Sorry," I say, though I am not the one with the running water.

She grunts and keeps mopping. The water she pushes toward the drain moves like it doesn't want to leave. The drain gurgles, slow and annoyed. The floor gleams, false shiny, like a knife.

I pass the open bathroom door and look in. The steam has fogged the mirror. The fluorescent light flickers once, twice, then holds. The second shower stall is half-open, the curtain stuck to itself. The pipe in there catches the light, a copper finger pointing at nothing. The floor under it is dark with damp. There is a rag on the ledge, probably a cleaner's, and a bar of soap that looks like it has been whittled by dozens of hands.

I swallow and keep walking. The shower noise follows me, a constant hiss.

Downstairs, the bar is in morning mode, which is a different kind of mess. The lights are dim, the floor is sticky, and someone is asleep on the couch with their shoes still on. The neon sign buzzes above the bar like a tired insect. The smell is stale beer, burnt toast, and citrus cleaner fighting a losing battle.

Kuba is at reception, hair a mess, t-shirt advertising some brand of Czech beer I can't pronounce. He looks up and grins.

"Morning, Brad the Lad. You live." He is always cheerful in a way that makes me feel like he either never sleeps or never stops pretending.

"Unfortunately," I say.

He slides a glass of water across the bar. "Hydrate, legend. Then you can poison yourself again. Noon beers start in..." He looks at his watch and squints. "Two hours." He says it like it is a public service.

I drink the water. It tastes like the pipes, metallic and cold. It sits in my stomach and makes the room feel steadier. I could stop there. I could be done. I laugh at myself in my head, because that will never be the story.

A couple of new arrivals come down the stairs dragging backpacks like dead weight. One of them has a sunburn already, in March, which feels like a performance. The other has a guidebook and a face that says he thinks he made a good decision. I have learned to be the one who makes them feel that way. It is part of my job as unofficial mayor of Mad House.

"Welcome to the madhouse," I say. "You two just get in?"

They nod, eyes wide.

"Bar's there," I point. "Showers are up, slightly dodgy but you'll be right. Floors are..." I search for the word. "Adventurous. Wear thongs, grab onto stuff. The Wi-Fi works if you stand on one foot in the corner." They laugh. I feel like a helpful legend instead of a warning sign.

The sunburnt one asks about tours. I tell him about the free walking tour that meets in the square, about the pub crawl that leaves at eight, about the castle if you want to pretend to be cultured. He asks which I recommend. I say, "Whichever one sells beer," and he laughs again, relieved that the world is as he expected.

Marta passes through the bar with her mop, wet trail behind her. She looks at us and shakes her head. "Tour? You want tour? Here tour," she says, sweeping her mop in a circle. "This is it. You stay, you drink, you die. Prague tour." She is joking. I think.

The boys laugh nervously and go to find bunks. I watch them for a moment, their clean skin, their clean backpacks, their optimism like a thing you can still carry. I remember being like that on day one. I remember thinking this place would be a story. It is a story. It just isn't the one I would tell my mum.

I grab a plate of toast from the kitchen, the slice burnt on one side, cold on the other. It tastes like charcoal and cheap butter. I eat it anyway. The kitchen smells like goulash from last night's family dinner, paprika and something meaty that makes my stomach roll. I swallow hard, take another bite.

By noon, the bar has warmed up. The first recovery beers are lined on the counter like medicine. I take one without thinking. The first sip is always a magic trick. It turns the world from harsh to soft. It sands down the sharp edges in my head. It makes me feel like a person again, like a guy who can keep going.

I check my phone. Another text from Mum. "Just a quick call?" The words are soft and tired. I put the phone face down. I tell myself I'll call after I have eaten properly, after I have had a nap, after I have done literally anything. I tell myself a lot of things.

---

The bar fills. A beer pong table appears. Someone starts a playlist called Kings of Prague. The dog from the courtyard wanders in and noses a backpack. I drop it a chip. It eats it and wags its tail once, a small mercy.

A girl with a nose ring sits next to me at the bar. Her name is Liv, she's from Leeds, and she says she slept on the couch because she couldn't find her bed. I tell her I slept on my bed, which is a lie if you count the hours I spent staring at the ceiling. She asks me if I ever get sick of this. I say, "Sick of Prague? Never." I don't say, "Sick of myself? Sometimes." She laughs anyway.

We play a drinking game with cards that have more rules than a visa application. I lose on purpose once because I can see her smile brighten, and I like that feeling, the tiny boost of making someone else feel good. Then I win two rounds in a row because I cannot resist the rush. My hand steadies as the beer works its way in. My laugh gets louder. My jokes get dumber. The room turns into a blur of cups and faces and noise.

The kitchen smells like paprika and burnt onions when they start the family dinner. The goulash is thick enough to stick to the spoon, red as a warning. I take a bowl because it looks responsible and because Kuba is watching, and I eat half of it before my stomach turns on me. I chase it with water, then beer, then a shot someone presses into my hand with a grin. The taste of stew and vodka is not a combination I would recommend to anyone I cared about. I laugh when my eyes water. Someone takes a photo of me mid-gag and posts it. I am a meme of myself.

On the whiteboard in the kitchen, someone has written DRINK WATER OR DIE in block letters. A little skull is drawn underneath. I take a picture and think about posting it, then put my phone away. It feels like tempting fate. It feels like it would get likes.

The sunburnt guy from the stairs earlier finds me by the bar and asks about that free walking tour again. He has a map open on his phone, all blue dots and heart icons. He is still in the stage where Prague is a place and not a blur. I should send him off to the square alone. I don't. I tell him I'll go if he wants. The word yes comes out of me like it always does.

We walk out into the afternoon, a ragtag trio because Liv decides she needs "culture" to balance out the beers. The air is cold and wet. My face feels tight with it. The cobblestones are slick from the earlier rain, each stone shining like it has been polished by feet and years. The tour guide is a woman with a yellow umbrella and a voice that could cut through a riot. She waves us over and starts talking about kings and defenestrations and the kind of history that makes Europe feel heavy. I try to listen. I keep thinking about where the next beer is.

We stand in the Old Town Square as the Astronomical Clock does its little performance. Tourists lift their phones like offerings. The figures come out, the crowd oohs, the crowd aahs, the crowd goes back to their screens. The clock is beautiful in the way old things are, not because it's nice, but because it has survived. I squint at it and feel a small, strange twist in my chest. If it can survive centuries of fire and war, why can't I survive a week without a drink? I answer the question by taking a swig from my plastic cup.

The guide talks about Charles IV. A busker plays "Wonderwall" on a violin. A small boy runs between tourists chasing pigeons. Liv takes a photo of a statue and asks me if I know who it is. I make up a name. She laughs. It feels good to be useful and wrong.

My head swims when I tilt it up. The sky is low and grey, a lid on the city. My legs feel like they are made of wet sand. I lean against a lamppost and pretend it is part of the tour. A Czech man with a cane passes by and says something that sounds like "pozor," careful. I smile and nod like I understand. When he is gone, I step off the curb and my foot slips on the slick stone. It is tiny, a nothing, but my stomach drops anyway. Liv grabs my elbow.

"You good?" she asks.

"All good," I say, because that is what I say.

We duck into a small shop to warm up. It is half souvenirs, half convenience store. I buy a bottle of water, a packet of paracetamol, and a sugar-dusted pastry that looks like it might fix something. The cashier doesn't look at me. I take two pills dry, then chase them with beer because I am nothing if not consistent. The water sits unopened in my bag like a lie.

By the time the tour ends, I am shivering and buzzing. I have learned facts I won't remember and taken pictures I won't look at. Liv says it was "wholesome," which is a word we say like a joke but mean a little. The sunburnt guy says he is glad he came. I am glad too, because it means I can say I did something besides drink, even if the drinking never stopped.

We walk back toward the hostel, passing the river where the water moves slow and dark. A swan glides past a couple of pedal boats full of tourists who look like they are already cold. The air smells like wet stone and diesel. The city is beautiful. I see it in flashes, like glimpses between sips.

---

Around three, Kuba bangs a bell and announces a pub crawl for anyone who wants to start early. Half the room cheers. The other half looks hungover and guilty. I should stay. I should be the guy who eats and sleeps and maybe calls his mother. I stand anyway, because I am the guy who says yes when the room says go.

We spill out into the afternoon, a loud, mismatched herd. Prague is wet and cold, the rain from earlier still clinging to the cobblestones. The sky is a dull, iron grey. The air smells like cigarettes and trdelnik and the river. The Vltava is somewhere close, unseen, but I can hear it in the distance, a low hush.

We walk past a statue I have promised myself I'd look up but never have. We pass a shop selling marionettes with wooden faces that look like they're judging us. We pass a church whose bells cut through the noise and make me feel small for a second. Someone tries to sing an off-key version of a football chant. It echoes off the stone and turns into a different kind of prayer.

Our first stop is a bar the crawl has a deal with, all exposed brick and sticky tables. The bartender pours shots lined up like a firing squad. I take mine and feel the burn settle into my stomach like a familiar friend. The room is loud, the walls sweating with other people's nights. A stag group from Birmingham is there, wearing matching shirts that say KISS THE GROOM. One of them bumps into me and spills beer on my shorts.

"Sorry, mate," he says, grinning.

"All good," I say, grinning back. It doesn't matter. Everything is already wet in my life.

We move to another bar, then another. The city slides by in postcard flashes: a bridge with statues dark against the sky, a tram squealing around a corner, a street musician playing something that sounds like a funeral but with a beat. I should be taking pictures. I should be collecting moments like stamps. Instead I'm collecting drinks. I tell myself that's the real culture here. It is a lie that keeps me moving.

At one point, we stop on the Charles Bridge because the guide says it's mandatory. Tourists shuffle past, holding phones up like shields. A couple is taking engagement photos in the drizzle. I watch them for a second, the way they lean into each other, the way the photographer tells them to laugh. I wonder what my life would look like if I hadn't left, if I hadn't turned everything into a party trick. The thought is like a cold splash. I take another sip of my beer to warm back up.

Liv links her arm through mine as we walk. She smells like citrus soap and cigarettes. "You ever been to Prague sober?" she asks.

I laugh. "I haven't been to a Tuesday sober," I say. She laughs too, then looks at me, eyes soft for a second.

"Is that..." she starts, then stops. "Never mind." She squeezes my arm and lets go.

By the time we get back to the hostel, it is dark. The courtyard is lit by a string of fairy lights that make the graffiti look like it is dancing. The bar downstairs is in full swing. A pre-game has become the party itself. The air is warm and wet and thick with bodies. The bass is a heartbeat. The walls hum with it.

We pour back into the bar and it swallows us. Someone hands me a cup of something blue. It tastes like medicine and sugar. I drink it anyway. The cups stack up on the bar like a record of bad decisions. I laugh too loud at jokes I don't hear. I shout when my team wins a round of Rage King. My voice scratches. I don't care.

At some point, we end up in the basement, the legendary cave. It is a storage room with a couch and a speaker, but it feels like a secret. The air is damp, the concrete walls sweating. Someone has drawn a skull on the wall in chalk. Someone else has written, in block letters, SLEEP WHEN YOU'RE DEAD. It is everywhere in this building, a mantra that keeps getting less funny.

I sit on the couch and watch the room. Faces in half-light, mouths open in laughter, eyes glossy. A guy with a beard is doing push-ups to prove he is not as drunk as he is. A girl is trying to teach a Czech word to an American who keeps mispronouncing it. Someone is crying in the corner, quietly, as if the noise around them will cover it. I feel my chest tighten at that. I look away and take another sip.

My phone buzzes again. A call from my sister. The screen glows in the dark like a small, accusing eye. I stare at it until it stops. I tell myself I will call her tomorrow. I have said that so many times that tomorrow feels like a country I will never visit.

We go back upstairs. The bar is hotter now, bodies pressed together, sweat in the air. The playlist has turned into a wall of bass. The neon sign buzzes like it might give up. I spot Kuba behind the bar, eyes bright, moving fast. He is in his element, and for a second I envy him. He looks like he belongs. I look like I am pretending to.

Liv bumps my shoulder. "Shot?" she shouts over the music.

"Always," I shout back.

We line up at the bar. The shots are clear and deadly. We clink glasses and down them. The burn is quick, the warmth immediate. The room tilts, then steadies. I laugh at something. It could be anything.

An hour later, I am in the courtyard, cool air on my face, cigarette smoke in my hair, the stone under my flip-flops slick with spilled beer and rain. The fountain gurgles. The fairy lights make everything look like a scene from a cheap music video. A couple is kissing in the corner like the world isn't ending. I lean against the wall and close my eyes for a second. The bass from inside thuds through the brick into my back.

I think about the shower. Not in a scary way, just in a practical way. A shower in the morning will fix me. It always does. Hair of the dog will sort this out. Water, then beer. That is the routine. The thought is a comfort, a plan, a line I can hold onto. I open my eyes and the fairy lights blur. I blink until they focus.

When I go back inside, someone has started a chant for me. "Brad the Lad! Brad the Lad!" It is ridiculous. It is flattering. It is also a cage. I raise my cup and give them a bow. The chant dies in laughter. I tell a stupid story about falling off a barstool in Budapest that may or may not have happened. They roar. I am a legend for fifteen seconds. It feels good. It feels like nothing.

Around two, the party slows only because bodies start giving up. People spill onto couches, onto the chill room floor, into corners. The bar keeps going for the survivors. I am one of them. That should feel like victory. It feels like a habit.

I drag myself upstairs eventually, the hallway swaying like a boat. The mop bucket is still under the stairs. The drip is still counting time. The wet floor sign has fallen over. I step around it and laugh softly, because it feels like a punchline and I am too tired to feel it.

The bathroom door is half-closed. I see the light flicker through the crack. I can smell the mildew, the damp concrete. A shower is running again, maybe for me, maybe for someone else. I pause outside the door, hand on the frame. The floor inside gleams. The pipe in the second stall catches the light, a thin line in the dim. It looks like a finger pointing, like it's telling me to come in. I imagine the water on my face, the cold first, then hot, the way it will rinse the night off. I imagine stepping in, letting the room spin, closing my eyes.

"Tomorrow," I tell the door. "Tomorrow morning. I'll do it right." I say it like a promise, like a joke.

I walk past. My flip-flops slap the tile. The shower keeps running behind me, a steady roar, like the ocean in a dream.

In the dorm, people are asleep in shapes that don't look comfortable. The air is heavy, humid from bodies and the radiator, and the window is cracked to let in the cold. I climb onto my bunk and lie on my back, arms wide, as if I can take in all the noise and the dark at once. My phone is in my hand. I type a message to Mum. "All good. Busy. Love you." I stare at it. I delete it. I put the phone face down.

My head throbs. The room spins slowly, like a record at the wrong speed. I close my eyes and the sound of water in the pipes threads through everything. It is a reminder and a lullaby. It is a thing waiting. I tell myself I will wake up, I will shower, I will be fine. I tell myself all the things that keep the night from feeling like a cliff.

Somewhere down the hall, a door clicks. Someone laughs in their sleep. The pipes tick. The water runs. The hostel breathes around me.

I fall asleep to the sound of a shower I am not in, and the promise of the one I will take.
