# Victim Profile

## Basic Information

**Full Name:** Bradley James O'Connor
**Nickname/Handle:** "Brad the Lad" / @BradGoesGlobal
**Age:** 22
**Nationality:** Australian (Gold Coast)
**Occupation:** "Taking a break from real life" (former apprentice electrician, quit)

## Archetype
**Primary:** Party Backpacker

**Secondary traits:**
- Lad culture embodiment
- Desperately trying to have "the best time ever"
- Hiding anxiety behind alcohol

## The Fatal Flaw
**Core Flaw:** Recklessness

**How it manifests:**
- Treats his body like it's invincible
- Drinks through pain, illness, and warning signs
- Takes unnecessary risks because "that's what stories are made of"

**How it kills them:**
Brad's years of partying have left him perpetually unsteady, dehydrated, and prone to blackouts. On this particular morning, still drunk from the night before, he attempts to shower in a bathroom with no non-slip mat, broken tiles, and exposed pipes. His compromised balance and the slippery conditions combine fatally.

## Physical Appearance
- **Height/Build:** 6'1", gym-built but softening from beer
- **Hair:** Bleached tips, fading (hasn't maintained since leaving Australia)
- **Distinguishing features:** Southern Cross tattoo on shoulder, multiple unexplained bruises at any time, perpetually bloodshot eyes
- **Typical outfit:** Singlet (tank top), board shorts, thongs (flip-flops) regardless of weather

## Personality

### Positive Traits (that get twisted)
1. Genuinely friendly and inclusive - becomes inability to say no to another round
2. Lives in the moment - becomes complete lack of self-preservation

### Negative Traits (that seal their fate)
1. Treats alcohol as personality - leads to perpetual impairment
2. Ignores physical warnings - leads to showering while still dangerously drunk

### Pet Peeves
- People who "can't hang" (don't drink as much)
- Being called an alcoholic (the word he won't say)
- Serious conversations

### Fears
- Surface fear: Missing out on the party
- Deeper fear: That the party is all he has, that he's nothing without it

## Background

### Origin Story
Grew up on the Gold Coast to divorced parents who both used him as a messenger for their mutual hatred. Started drinking at 14, discovered it made him popular and numb. Became "Brad the Lad" by 16 and never looked back. Apprenticeship was going well until his boss suggested he had a problem. He quit the next day and booked a flight to Europe.

### Why They Travel
To party. That's it, that's the reason. The thinnest veneer of "seeing the world" but really just moving from party hostel to party hostel. Running from the realization that his lifestyle isn't sustainable.

### How They Ended Up at This Hostel
Prague is THE party destination. This hostel is THE party hostel. Brad's been here for two weeks, far longer than planned. He keeps saying "one more night" every night. The staff know him by name.

## Voice & Speech

### Vocabulary
- Uses words like: "legend," "hectic," "sicko," "fully," "mate," "reckon," "smashed"
- Avoids words like: "problem," "worried," "scared," "help"
- Catchphrases: "Let's GO!", "One more won't hurt," "Sleep when I'm dead"

### Speech Pattern
- Loud, enthusiastic, abbreviated
- Australian slang heavy even for an Australian
- Gets louder as he drinks (always drinking)
- Slight slur that's become permanent

### Internal Monologue Style
Surprisingly quiet and scared. When he's alone, the anxiety creeps in. He drinks to silence it. His internal voice is much younger and more vulnerable than his party persona suggests.

## Digital Presence

### Social Media
- **Platform of choice:** Instagram (stories of nights out), TikTok (drinking content)
- **Follower count:** 3,200 (mostly fellow party backpackers he's met)
- **Posting style:** Shaky videos of nights out, morning-after "destruction" photos, always with a drink in hand
- **Last post before death:** Story of the previous night with caption "DAY 14 IN PRAGUE STILL GOING STRONG" with red eyes filter because his real eyes were too red

### Online vs Reality
Online: Living his best life, king of the party, legend. Reality: Hasn't been sober in 6 months, increasingly scared of what he's becoming, can't sleep without passing out, body breaking down.

## Relationships

### Family
- Mother: Worried texts he doesn't respond to because guilt
- Father: Stopped trying years ago
- Sister: The one person who sees through him, their last call ended with her crying and him drinking

### Friends
- "Mates" everywhere - actually acquaintances who party with him
- Actual friends back home have given up
- Current travel companion ditched him in Berlin, said it was "too much"

### Romantic
- Series of drunk hookups he barely remembers
- One girl in Barcelona almost got through to him; he ghosted her

### At the Hostel
- Everyone knows Brad
- Some admire him, some are concerned, most just party with him
- Staff have had to carry him to bed twice
- Roommates have complained about his snoring (alcohol-induced)

## The Day They Die

### Morning
Woke at 10 AM still drunk from the night before. Head pounding. Vision blurry. Mouth dry. Stomach threatening. The room smells like vomit and beer. He decides a shower will help before the "recovery beers" start at noon.

### Their Last Normal Moment
Standing at the bathroom door, towel over shoulder, feeling the familiar spinning. Thinking "hair of the dog will sort this out."

### Final Thoughts
Lying on the shower floor, feeling oddly peaceful: "Mum's gonna be so upset. I should've called her back. I should've..." Then nothing.

### Last Words
"Whoaa--" (as he slips)
