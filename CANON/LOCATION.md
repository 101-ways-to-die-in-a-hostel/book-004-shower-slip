## The Staff

### Reception
**Name:** Jakub "Kuba" Novak
**Description:** 26, former party guest who never left, now runs reception, personally knows every trick because he invented half of them
**Role in death:** Oblivious - assumed Brad was "just drunk again"

### Other Staff
| Role | Name | Notable Trait |
|------|------|---------------|
| Cleaner | Marta (different Marta) | 50s, hates this job, does minimum possible, knows everything is disgusting |
| Security | Petr | 30, bouncer type, handles truly out-of-control guests, mostly sympathetic |
| Bar/Kitchen | Rotating backpackers | Work-for-stay arrangement, complicit in the chaos |
| Manager | Filip | 35, sees the hostel as "an experience, not a hotel," resists all safety improvements |

### Staff Knowledge
Everyone knows the bathrooms are dangerous. Jakub has personally helped three people who slipped. Marta refuses to clean the floor shower properly because "it just gets dirty again." Filip has been advised to install grab bars and mats; he considers it "killing the vibe."

## Hostel Atmosphere

### Day Vibe
Recovering. Hungover bodies scattered like a battlefield. The "hair of the dog" crowd starting at noon. Smell of regret and toast. Staff cleaning up last night's damage.

### Night Vibe
Escalating chaos. Pre-game at 6 PM. Full party by 10 PM. Peak insanity midnight-2 AM. Gradual collapse 3-5 AM. Repeat nightly.

## Real-World Research

### Accuracy Notes
- Prague party hostels have genuine reputations for excess
- Bathroom safety is legitimately poor in budget accommodations
- Alcohol-related hostel deaths documented but rarely publicized
- Czech Republic has very low drinking age enforcement

### Cultural Sensitivity
- Czech people are not responsible for tourist behavior
- The hostel is run by a local but caters to international party culture
- Don't frame Prague as only a party destination
- Czech drinking culture is different from binge-drinking tourist culture

### Sources
- News reports on hostel accidents in Europe
- Travel blogs about party hostels
- Safety standards in EU accommodations
- Medical literature on bathroom falls
